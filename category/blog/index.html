        <h4>May 2021</h4>
        
        <p>The Haywain by John Constable, perhaps the most famous English painting, depicts Flatford in Suffolk which I know well as it is only a few miles from where I live and I often take my little West Highland Terrier out for walks in that direction.</p>

        <h4>April 2021</h4>
        
        <p>A few days ago I did a short podcast with my son Alfie. We wrestled with the question that if architecture is 'frozen music', as Goethe suggests, what sort of music should architects play.</p>

        <p>One of my favourite houses is Townley Hall in in County Louth, Ireland. It is not open to the public but the institution that owns it are happy for enthusiasts to look round, which I did a many years ago.</p>

        <p>Quality is so important. It is the different between mass produced bleached white sliced bread assembled in a factory and bread lovingly made in small batches by a baker who really cares. The ingredients are much the same, but the differences are enormous.</p>

        <h4>January 2021</h4>
        
        <p>Architects for millennia have sought to find rules to determine the proportions of every aspect of a building. A window, for example, can look too narrow and thin or conversely it can look squat and fat. How can we work out the right proportions?</p>

        <p>This latest offering is a comic I wrote many years ago. Not much to do with architecture but as it’s nearly Christmas I thought I’d post something lighthearted and I am sure we all need cheering up as it’s been a tough year for everyone. The plot follows my alter ego crossed with Tintin who falls into Italy’s dark criminal underbelly after finding his uncle murdered in a suburb of Milan...</p>

        <h4>November 2020</h4>
        
        <p>Until recently my knowledge of Manchester architecture was limited to the inside gatefold of ‘The Queen is Dead’ LP. This shows the Smith’s standing outside the Salford Lads Club, where a terracotta Scamozzi Ionic capital can be seen cheekily peaking our over Morissey’s shoulder. I imagined the rest of the city continued in this vein, which indeed it does but with a scale, grandeur and flamboyance I could have only dreamed of.</p>

        <h4>October 2020</h4>
        
        <p>Many people, would love to build a new house in the country. The problem is getting planning permission. But don't despair, NPPF paragraph 79e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of 'paragraph 79e' houses.</p>

        <h4>September 2020</h4>
        
        <p>In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.</p>

        <p>When I walked up to the front of Versailles I was struck by how unimpressive it was despite all the money spent on it. When I returned home and aided by the extra time which the coronavirus lockdown has generated, I set myself the task of redesigning Versailles.</p>

        <p>As lockdown is slowly being relaxed, more building sites are looking to return to productivity. Is there a safer, easier to police way of building houses that would enable social distancing to be maintained whilst still being productive and efficient?</p>

        <p>The highest praise one can give an artist is to say he or she draws like Raphael. It comes in the same package as writing like Shakespeare or ‘bending it like Beckham’. As I can’t write poetry and don’t play football the latter two challenges are not open to me, but drawing like Raphael... how hard can it be?</p>
