In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.

I became interested in an intriguing hidden window which lit the alter from the side. This illuminated a carved marble base relief of the ecstatic body of St Francis, suspended in mid air by angels. The light, which seemed to come from nowhere, would seem like a miracle to the original worshippers who would never have seen an electric light. To give this composition even more potency, the magical light was from the east and so would be seen as Devine. East light has been worshiped for millennia and in a prescientific age, when people who instinctively were scared of the dark and saw the coming of a new day as a gift from the gods, this was not to be sniffed at. This pagan belief is ironically central to Christian theology. The line in Luke’s gospel ‘Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us’ illustrates this belief and this is why most European churches face east. It is not to face Jerusalem as I thought for many years but to face the rising sun. 

At the time, this side chapel was full of scaffolding which no one seemed to be attending to. This was very useful, because it allowed me to measure high up details which would otherwise be in accessible.

One rainy Saturday I was happily measuring and I heard some organ music wafting in, initially I thought it was just someone practicing, but when I peeped out I noticed that the church was full with a wedding going on. I did not want to make a spectacle of myself so hid back in the chapel and carried on measuring. I then heard what I thought was the wedding ending so decided to make my move, but to my dismay it was the opening hymn for another wedding. It must have been peek season, because by the time I could get out tactfully I had witnessed three weddings!

Another time, in the same chapel, I was working quite late and I got locked in. A priest was completing some hocus-pocus over the alter, when he saw me he rolled his eyes - perhaps thinking he would have to redo the ritual. I moved away, and suddenly the lights went ou, he had locked me in a dark church!  I wondered around trying to find a way out, eventually in almost total darkness finding the front door. This was years before mobile phones existed and so I was beginning to get quite worried. Fortunately it was bolted from the inside, so I undid the bolts and got out, leaving the church with priceless works of art ready for the taking. I saw a policeman across the road and told him that the church was open. He did not seem particularly interested. I don’t think anything was stolen - I never checked.
