	On 14th November the RIBA's Traditional Architecture Group hosted a reception at the Art Workers' Guild. The occasion was well attended by both architects and practitioners in related fields. In his speech as Chairman, Francis emphasised the debt of all architects to craftsmen and builders in realising their dreams. In recognition of this, the society has therefore been opened to non-architects as associate members to further this collaborative spirit. The speech ended with a toast to the Prince of Wales whose birthday it was and in acknowledgment of the tremendous effect he has had on traditional architecture.
