We are happy to hear that our design for a new house in Hampshire has been given planning permission by East Hampshire District Council. The design reflects local architectural characteristics, with the use of red brick, weatherboarding, clay tile roofing and traditional vernacular details. The scheme was commissioned and project managed by Finchatton and the landscape designer was Christian Sweet of Coulson Stone, both of whom we work with frequently and continue to collaborate.
