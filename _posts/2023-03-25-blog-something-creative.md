As any crafter will know, starting a project is one thing – finishing it is something totally different!

For Francis Terry and his family the lockdown has meant a project which was started in February has become a real focus for quality time together, and as well as being admired by many of Francis’s followers via social media, it was picked up by Architectural Digest <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/this-english-family-is-painting-its-way-through-the-pandemic" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who ran this story</a>.

We hope it inspires you to start (and complete) something creative if you find yourself with more time during this lockdown.
