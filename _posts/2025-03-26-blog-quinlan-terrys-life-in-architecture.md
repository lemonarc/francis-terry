His life has seen classical and traditional architecture change from being derided as a joke and even immoral in the ‘50s and ‘60s, to its adoption by Prince Charles and the Post-Modern movement in the ‘80s, and now its total acceptance. With a broad variety of topics discussed, this interview will interest architects and non-architects alike."

This video is an interview between Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE, discussing the many unforgettable moments in his highly successful sixty-year career. His life has seen classical and traditional architecture change from being derided as a joke and even immoral in the ‘50s and ‘60s, to its adoption by Prince Charles and the Post-Modern movement in the ‘80s, and now its total acceptance.

As well as an investigation into these broad cultural trends, Quinlan recounts many of the amusing anecdotes that punctuated his career: these include, working with Profumo during the scandal, collaborating with Sir Anthony Blunt on researching Renaissance architecture, and being in Libya measuring Roman ruins at the time of the Gaddafi coup d'état.

With a broad variety of topics discussed, this interview will interest architects and non-architects alike.
