We are delighted that our design for a new house in Virginia Water, Surrey has been granted planning consent by Runneymede Borough Council. The design is a classical brick house with stone and painted timber embellishments. It is a particularly exciting project for the practice, as it is the first house we have designed for the prestigious Wentworth Estate.
