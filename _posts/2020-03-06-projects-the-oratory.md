<h2>Poundbury, Dorset</h2>
<p>
	The Oratory, which is the first religious building at Poundbury, is a modest but elegant chapel of yellow stock brick with an entrance front defined by four stone pilasters. Their Corinthian capitals, drawn by Francis Terry, do not have the traditional acanthus leaves but rather have the three white feathers that have featured on the heraldic badge of successive Princes of Wales from the fourteenth century to the present day. The entablature has a full modillion cornice that is carried around the crowning pediment with a large central cartouche carved with the Prince of Walesâ€™s feathers. Centrally placed below is the entrance doorway to the chapel, which has a bold stone surround of Gibbsian blocked rustication.
