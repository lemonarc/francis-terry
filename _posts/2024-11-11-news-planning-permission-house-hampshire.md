We are delighted that our design for a new house in Hampshire has been given planning permission by South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA). This scheme is particularly exciting as the site was originally laid out by Charles Bridgeman, one of the greatest English landscape designers of the 18th century. The house is designed in the classical style but subtly adapted to fulfil the functional requirements of modern family life. The materials used include brick, stone and flint which reflect local architectural character. The scheme was project managed by Finchatton, the landscape designer was Christian Sweet of Coulson Stone, and the planning consultant was Scot Masker of Masker Architects.
