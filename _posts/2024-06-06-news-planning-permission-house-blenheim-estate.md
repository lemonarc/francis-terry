We are delighted that our new house in the grounds of Blenheim Palace has been granted planning permission. This is a particularly prestigious consent as the house is within a Grade 1 listed landscape and on a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The standard required by UNESCO, Historic England and West Oxford District Council is understandably of the highest level. We are therefore honoured to be the architects for such a significant consent. The Country House expert Jeremy Musson commended the design in the following way:

<em>
	“The proposed house will become the comfortable and elegant centrepiece of an enclosed and inhabited grove within the wider story of Blenheim – another chapter in the unfolding Marlborough/Spencer-Churchill story and is designed as the permanent and future residence of the Marquis and Marchioness of Blandford, their family and successors.”
