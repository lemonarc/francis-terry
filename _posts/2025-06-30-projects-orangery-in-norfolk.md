The new orangery at a house in Norfolk, completed in 2017, was conceived as a sensitive yet striking extension to the existing home. Designed to meet the evolving needs of contemporary family living, the space was intended primarily to house a large open-plan kitchen and informal living area—functions that now form the social heart of the modern home. The goal was not only to increase the footprint of the property but also to enhance the quality of light, flow, and connection to the surrounding garden.

Architecturally, the orangery takes its inspiration from the Queen Anne period, a time known for its refined detailing and elegance. This influence is most clearly expressed through the inclusion of tall, generously proportioned windows which allow natural light to flood the interior throughout the day, creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere. The use of red brickwork further ties the new addition to the traditional vernacular of the region, reinforcing a sense of continuity between old and new.

</ul>
In order to achieve a high level of craftsmanship and a subtle, timeless aesthetic, special attention was paid to the construction techniques and materials. One notable detail is the use of thinner mortar joints than those typically found in modern brick buildings. This decision was made to replicate the finer, more delicate appearance associated with historic brickwork, helping the new structure to sit harmoniously alongside both the existing house and the wider architectural heritage of the area.

</ul>

Careful consideration was given to proportions, detailing, and material transitions to ensure that the orangery reads as a distinct architectural element in its own right, while still harmonising with the character and form of the original house. Rather than attempting to replicate the existing structure, the design takes a complementary approach—respecting the historic fabric of the home while clearly expressing its own identity. The result is an elegant, functional, and light-filled space that enhances the daily life of its occupants and pays quiet homage to the architectural traditions that inspired it.
