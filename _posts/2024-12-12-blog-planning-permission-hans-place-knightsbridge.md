We are thrilled to be part of a team which have been granted planning consent for a pair of new houses in Hans Place, Knightsbridge. The new building replaces a modernist style house built in the 1960s, which is unsympathetic to the area both in terms of materials and architectural language. The new design follows the dominant style of the square which consists of highly ornate red brick facades with brown stone and terracotta elements, using a classical style borrowed from diverse sources, including 17th century Dutch and Queen Anne influences.
