We are delighted that our design for a new house in Surrey has been given planning permission by Waverley Borough Council. The design reflects local architectural characteristics with the use of stone and red brick, with a clay tile roof. The architectural detailing owes much to the Surrey vernacular and the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens who practiced extensively in the area. The planning submission was coordinated by Janet Long of Planit Consulting and the landscape design was by Nick Tripp of Taylor Tripp.
