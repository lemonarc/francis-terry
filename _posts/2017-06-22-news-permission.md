	We have just been granted planning consent for a new Palladian house in south Norfolk. Despite officer concerns about fulfilling all the NPPF paragraph 55 criteria, it was passed by committee with a unanimous vote from the councillors. The permission was passed by making use of the NPPF exception, which allows new truly outstanding houses to be built in open countryside if they are deemed to be 'exceptional' works of architecture. It is a high bar for any architect to achieve and it would have not happened without the excellent planning team, headed up by Martin Leay, with Timothy Carless for garden design and to ensure significant enhancement of the local setting.
