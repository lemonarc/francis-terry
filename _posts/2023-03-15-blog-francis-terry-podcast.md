Most of us have experienced boredom to some extent or other during this lockdown. You may have noticed that Francis Terry has been overcoming this by trying different drawing styles (see the April blog – <a href="/thoughts/how-to-draw-like-raphael/" alt="How to Draw Like Raphael">How to Draw Like Raphael</a>).  Another new string to his bow has been uploading his first podcast.

In this Francis is interviewed by his son, and the nuggets of wisdom they discuss include:
<ul>
<li>Who was the best classical architect?</li>
<li>What’s important about classical architecture?</li>
<li>Why is Gothic architecture so appealing?</li>
</ul>

Francis hopes to create more podcasts to entertain himself – and hopefully you – over the coming months. Please feel free to use the social media links at the bottom of the website to message us with suggestions for future talks.
