A few days ago I did a short podcast with my son Alfie. We talked about many things, but to kick off we discussed the romantic view of beauty in which artists aimed to ‘stun’ and not necessarily please. This led on to a conversation about the rock band Joy Division and we wrestled with the question that if architecture is ‘frozen music’, as Goethe suggests, what sort of music should architects play.
