	On Wednesday April 24th at 6.30pm, Francis Terry will be giving a lecture titled ‘Glad to be Pastiche’. Having studied the origin of the word and what it actually means, he found that far from being an insult, it is a compliment of the highest order. He discovered that famous ‘pasticheurs’ include Palladio and Inigo Jones in architecture, Mozart and Tchaikovsky in music and Velazquez and Picasso in painting. With examples, Francis will show how being pastiche is something to be celebrated and an essential part of all good architecture. His book ‘Glad to be Pastiche and other Essays’ will be available for sale at £10.
