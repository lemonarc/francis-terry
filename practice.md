<p>We are an architectural practice engaged in a broad range of projects both in the UK and overseas.  Our approach is to design buildings which satisfy the needs of our clients while simultaneously creating beautiful architecture.  The team has a wealth of experience in design and construction which is combined with a thorough understanding of the rules of classical architecture. </p>

<p>For a client, the commissioning of a building can be a wonderful experience and we aim to make this process both enjoyable and stimulating.  We work in a variety of ways depending on the level of involvement required.  We are very happy to collaborate alongside a client's team or with professionals known to us.  For us, no two projects are alike and we enjoy the different challenges each one brings. </p>

			<h2>Francis Terry</h2>
			<h4>MA (Cantab), Dip Arch, RIBA <br />Director</h4>
			</a>
			<p>
				Francis is part of a new generation of classical architects who have recently gained a reputation for designing high quality works of architecture.  Francis's pursuit of architecture grew out of his passion for drawing and his love of historic buildings. He studied architecture at Cambridge University qualifying in 1994.  While at Cambridge, he used his architectural skills to design numerous stage sets for various dramatic societies including The Footlights, The Cambridge Opera Society and The European Theatre Group. 
			</p><p>
				After briefly working for Allan Greenburg Architects in Washington DC, Francis spent over 20 years working with his father the eminent classical architect Quinlan Terry with whom he became a partner in 2004. As a partner he developed his reputation as an independent architect, winning competitions and working on his own commissions. Consequently, he formed his own practice in 2016 in order to continue his own creative path. 
			</p><p>
				Alongside his architectural interests Francis is a keen artist and uses his talent to draw schemes and paint watercolours of his proposals.  Francis has won the Winsor and Newton Young Artist Award from the Royal Society of Oil Painters and the Silver Medal from the Royal Society of Portrait Painters both in 1997. He also regularly exhibits drawings in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and won the Worshipful Company of Architects Prize for Architectural Drawing in 2002. 
			</p><p>
				Francis is the current Chairman of the Traditional Architecture Group, a linked society to the RIBA.
