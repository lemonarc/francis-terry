## How do you get an architect to design the house of your dreams?

This is my role and so my aim is to take your vision and turn it into reality. I therefore need to understand exactly what you require, and this can only be done by having focus time with you at the earliest stage of the design. I therefore carry out what I call taster days at the beginning of the project. This is a day I would spend with you; we would start the day with a walk around the potential site and discuss where the house should go. This gives us time to consider all aspects of the site in terms of potentials and problems. I then sit down with you and start drawing out the scheme. On a usual taster day, over the course of the day, I can sketch out a whole house in concept form. These drawings can be used by you to see what the house would look like and how it would function. You should also have enough information to get a preliminary understanding of the scale of the whole venture in terms of costs and planning viability.

I insist on clients sitting with me throughout this process. This is your opportunity to provide essential feedback as I draw. In this way I can draw a house design which is tailor made for you.

	</li>
</ul>

Also, if I’m designing for a couple, they can talk between each other and work out what priorities they have and come out with a solution that satisfies both. This process alone can save a huge amount of time. I have found solving these design issues by email takes months and does not really get to the heart of the matter.

At the end of the day, you will have a set of drawings which you can use however you see fit. My hope is always that I have a good rapport with you, and you go forward with me to design your house but there is no obligation.

Taking a whole day might seem a lot of time for anyone with a busy life, but I would argue it is a quick way of developing a scheme and seeing if I’m the right architect for you…Your relationship with me as your architect is critical to the success and enjoyment of the project.

Lastly, I want you to have fun. I want you to enjoy working with me and to find the process stimulating and productive. Designing a new house is a huge and exciting venture and, for me, it is essential that you enjoy the whole process, from first sketch to the built house.
