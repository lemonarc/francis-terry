		<h2>NPPF Paragraph 84e Explained</h2>
		<h4>March 2024</h4>
		<p>
			Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 84e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 84e’ houses.

		<h2>How to Draw Like Raphael</h2>
		<h4>April 2020</h4>
		<p>
			The highest praise one can give an artist is to say he or she draws like Raphael. It comes in the same package as writing like Shakespeare or ‘bending it like Beckham’. As I can’t write poetry and don’t play football the latter two challenges are not open to me, but drawing like Raphael... how hard can it be?

		<h2>An Introduction to 18th Century Architecture: From Rococo to Neo Classicism</h2>
		<h4>December 2019</h4>
		<p>
			The 18th century is where I go routinely for inspiration. There is something magical about Georgian architecture which everyone seems to enjoy no matter who they are. Historically I see the 18th century as the transition from traditional society to the modern world. As catholicism gradually lost its power, the Baroque style also began to lose its grip and evolved into the Rococo. Like the last moments of a dying star which produces the many and varied elements of the universe, the Rococo was Baroque in an explosive, dynamic and beautiful decline.

		<h2>An Introduction to British Architecture from Queen Victoria to George VI</h2>
		<h4>March 2020</h4>

			The Victorian age inherited the battle of styles which defined the end of the Georgian era, a battle which was not convincingly won by either side. Gothic, Classical and even Mughal style architecture were all available to patrons and architects.

		<h4>March 2020</h4>

			It is hard to imagine the decimation caused by the First World War. Understandably, a growing number of people started to feel that there was something terribly wrong with a civilisation which caused young boys from neighbouring countries to commit murder for a purpose that no one really knew or understood.
