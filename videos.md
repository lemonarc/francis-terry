		<h4>May 2025</h4>

			The proportions and defining features of the five orders of columns are a fundamental part of classical architecture. In this video, Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE delve deep into this cornerstone of the profession. From the rustic undecorated Tuscan order to the detailed and ornate Composite, they reflect on their usage over the years, their rich symbolism as well as the mysterious question of their distant origins.

		<h4>March 2025</h4>
		<p>
			This video is an interview between Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE, discussing the many unforgettable moments in his highly successful sixty-year career. His life has seen classical and traditional architecture change from being derided as a joke and even immoral in the ‘50s and ‘60s, to its adoption by Prince Charles and the Post-Modern movement in the ‘80s, and now its total acceptance. With a broad variety of topics discussed, this interview will interest architects and non-architects alike.

		<h4>March 2024</h4>
		<p>
			Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 84e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 84e’ houses.

As I can’t write poetry and don’t play football the latter two challenges are not open to me, but drawing like Raphael... how hard can it be?

		<h2>An Introduction to 18th Century Architecture: From Rococo to Neo Classicism</h2>
		<h4>December 2019</h4>
		<p>
			The 18th century is where I go routinely for inspiration. There is something magical about Georgian architecture which everyone seems to enjoy no matter who they are. Historically I see the 18th century as the transition from traditional society to the modern world. As catholicism gradually lost its power, the Baroque style also began to lose its grip and evolved into the Rococo. Like the last moments of a dying star which produces the many and varied elements of the universe, the Rococo was Baroque in an explosive, dynamic and beautiful decline.
