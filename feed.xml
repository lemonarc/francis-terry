		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architects for millennia have sought to find rules to determine the proportions of every aspect of a building. A window, for example, can look too narrow and thin or conversely it can look squat and fat. How can we work out the right proportions? Is there a ratio of height to width which is perfect? Many architects throughout time have felt there are mathematical formulae to achieve the right proportions. This was a particular interest of Renaissance theorists including the Florentine architect Alberti (1404-72) who saw an equivalence between musical and architectural proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am every day more and more convinced of the truth of Pythagoras’s saying, that nature is sure to act consistently and with constant analogy in all her operations: from whence I conclude, that the same numbers, by means of which the agreement of sound affects our ears with delight, are the very same which please our eyes and our minds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;The Ten Books of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; by Alberti book IX Chapter V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic maths behind musical harmony has a clarity and simplicity which appealed to the Renaissance mind. If you take two violin strings under the same tension, with one half the length of the other, and then pluck them both, the difference in pitch is an octave which sounds beautiful. In mathematical terms what you are really enjoying is the ratio of 1:2. If the strings are in a relationship of two to three you have a ‘fifth’ and if they are in a relationship of three to four it will be a ‘fourth’, all beautiful sounds as a consequence of being specific and exact mathematical ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just with strings that these ratios can be observed. The same patterns can be seen in different sized bells, different lengths of metal pipe in brass bands or church organ and the different sizes of wood blocks for a xylophone.  The maths throughout these various ways of making different pitches of sound is the same and so they work with each other. If, for example, a trumpet player was to blow down a long brass tube he or she could make the notes of an arpeggio. This wind instrument’s arpeggio would fit exactly into the previously mentioned octave of the stringed instrument, if they are tuned to the same pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/02a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Alberti states, these ideas ultimately go back to the great philosopher and mathematician Pythagorus in the 6th century BC.  He became aware of this when he walked past a blacksmith’s forge and heard the different pitches of the banging on anvils with different sized hammers. When some hammers banged at the same time, they sounded harmonious and others not. He then worked out that the hammers which achieved a pleasant sound were the ones which had a harmonic relationship between each other. For example, if one hammer was exactly twice as heavy as the other, that would produce an octave. He then went on to discover the basic maths of the musical instruments of his day. Through this he came to believe that the same simple number ratios and proportions embodied absolute truth about the harmonic structure of literally everything on earth. But Pythagoras did not stop there, he also was convinced that the same numbers and ratios were consistent throughout the whole universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If earthly objects such as strings or pieces of metal make sounds when put in motion, so too must the moon, the planets, the sun and even the highest stars. As these heavenly objects are forever in motion, orbiting the Earth, surely they must be forever producing sound.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea, known as the ‘Music of the Spheres’, is the belief that the planets and moon spin on their obits, emitting a hum, which is inaudible to us but if we could hear it, it would be some sort of celestial music expressing the perfect harmony of the universe. The planets which are further away were thought to make a lower hum than the ones closer to earth, it was as if the universe was one massive lute or harp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wonderful it would be to believe that certain proportions embody timeless irrefutable truths which are consistent throughout nature, music and architecture. It is so satisfyingly neat… but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we still look for magical formulae to explain the complexities of the universe and this is as true for Pythagorus as it is for Einstein.  In music the octave, the fourth and the fifth still sound beautiful and are used by musicians both ancient and modern. But for architecture, does the analogy work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not think that musical and architectural proportions work the same way. For architectural proportions to be ‘harmonic’ they do not have to be exact. For example, if the double cube room at Wilton was not quite a double cube, is would not be any better or worse, it aims to be a cube and near enough is fine. Architectural proportion is like Goldilocks’s porridge, slightly too hot or cold is fine it is a matter of degree, the closer the better. Music is not like this, slightly wrong is the most discordant sound possible. If an octave is slightly off it sounds completely wrong, even the most tone-deaf person can hear when a violin is even slightly out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/06.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure Palladio would have enjoyed someone post rationalising one for his buildings in terms of musical ratios, but I do not think he would have been at all familiar with these ideas and he certainly did not use them in practice. I can find no written reference to this Pythagorean musical analogy in his Quattro Libri. There may be some number ratios within his designs which appear to have a reference to these ideas but as D. Howard and M. Longair state in their essay ‘Harmonic Proportions and Palladio’s Quattro Libri’ ‘…this is more likely to be down to the practical advantages of using simple easily divisible numbers’. Which makes perfect sense particularly at a time when buildings were set out by lengths of rope and crudely pegged out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/07a.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/07a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly chimes with my understanding of Palladio’s architectural details. With his orders in the Quattro Libri, there is no attempt to use simple numbers let alone clean musical ratios. For example, the height of his Corinthian order is nine and a half times the length of the bottom diameter (rather that an even ten) and the entablature height is one diameter plus nine tenths (rather than an even two). The smaller scale details of the Corinthian order are just the same, virtually every dimension has a fraction attached and this is true for all his orders. Palladio’s drive was to represent a particular form or shape based on his knowledge of the ruins from Ancient Rome and his instinct for proportion. He therefore used whatever numbers and fractions worked to give him the exact dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one set of proportions which I believe are inherently beautiful, these are the classical orders from Ancient Rome. Quite why these proportions are so beautiful is hard to fathom but what is clear is they have nothing to do with musical ratios. In John Summerson’s excellent essay ‘Antitheses of the Quattrocento’ he sums it up in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you are unwilling to accept the five orders as a gift of a myth, delightful and glorious fundamentally because they derive from an old, forgotten world, then you must argue yourself into believing that, somehow or other, they embody absolute values of proportion and ornament; and that argument is difficult in the extreme.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If proportion cannot be attached to some absolute values all we are left with is personal judgement. There is a story about Michelangelo being criticised for making the cornice on Palazzo Farnese too large according to classical rules. To which he replied, ‘My eye is my measure’. Michelangelo, perhaps justifiable felt that his innate sense of proportion was enough with no recourse to anything else. He was effectively saying ‘I know what I like’, which does not sound like a valid architectural theory but perhaps that is all there is, and we should be honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/11.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the office we spend hours analysing our designs and trying different proportions of windows and doors in slightly different places to ensure that we have designed the best possible building within the given constraints. It is worth taking time to get these things right because a well-proportioned building costs the same as a badly proportioned one yet is worth so much more. We do this primarily by intuition. This process is not academic or theoretical, but if some latter-day Alberti comes along and finds musical ratios in my work which ties into some greater cosmic order, I certainly will not complain but it does not make it true.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Graphic Novel</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/looking-for-spinoza/LFS-00.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/looking-for-spinoza/thumbs/LFS-00.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Graphic Novel&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, before we were married, Miranda and I went on holiday to Italy and while traveling between cities on trains I started to write a novel in the back of my sketch book. The story was a mash up between the ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Day of the Jackal’ set in Italy and New England. After a day of writing I proudly read it to Miranda. She patiently listened to the whole thing and when had I finished, I asked her excitedly what she thought of it. She said, I quote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘That’s the biggest pile of crap I have ever heard!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well that’s honest… I suppose… not the reaction I wanted but fair enough.’ I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not particularly literate and I don’t often read novels so my attempt to write one was like a child on an ice rink for the first time seeing someone doing a pirouette and thinking ‘how hard can it be’. I put it away and never really thought about it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a decade later, Miranda and I are now married with three small children and I’m trying to amuse them by drawing cartoons. I could not think of a subject for a comic strip and then I remembered that story I had written all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the sketchbook and started to draw it out as a comic. Once I started writing I could not stop, I found it extremely addictive. The result is below and is called ‘Looking for Spinoza’ although it’s has nothing to do with the famous philosophically inclined lens grinder from Holland. The plot instead follows my alter ego crossed with Tintin who falls into Italy’s dark criminal underbelly after finding his uncle murdered in a suburb of Milan. As the story unfolds, he encounters a tattooed sword swallower, an incompetent assassin, a corrupt chief of police and an exploding shark all in his search for the illusive crime fighting mastermind…Ben Spinoza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its initial frosty reception, Ruth Gilding of ‘Bible of British Taste’ fame was very taken with it and she passed it on to her husband, the great A.N.Wilson who described it as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Suspenseful and with a nail-biting plot reversal on almost every page, Looking for Spinoza is both an exciting graphic novel in its own right and an amusing parody of the fast moving thriller.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generous praise indeed! He felt it deserved to be published and he put me in touch Dan Franklin, the publishing director of Jonathan Cape. Had I known that he worked with some of the biggest names in contemporary fiction including Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Martin Amis, I might have taken it more seriously. I met him at his office in Pimlico and he seemed interested and I remember him saying dryly ‘I think it’s very funny’ without cracking a smile. Much as he liked it, he felt it needed better structure, a proper beginning middle and end. I tried briefly to do as he said but I realised it would mean rewriting the whole thing and so I just left it, perhaps to be resumed when I have more time on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘What has this got to do with architecture?’ you might say. Not much, but it’s nearly Christmas I thought I’d post something lighthearted and I am sure we all need cheering up as it’s been a tough year for everyone. Also, if you look carefully you will see works by Bramante, Palladio and Raymond Erith, as well as views of Udine, Milan, Venice and Verona which all go to provide a classical setting for a highly unclassical story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently my knowledge of Manchester architecture was limited to the inside gatefold of ‘The Queen is Dead’ LP. This shows the Smith’s standing outside the Salford Lads Club, where a terracotta Scamozzi Ionic capital can be seen cheekily peaking our over Morissey’s shoulder. I imagined the rest of the city continued in this vein, which indeed it does but with a scale, grandeur and flamboyance I could have only dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to visit Manchester recently and if you have a taste for Edwardian Baroque architecture, this is the place to go. I am using the term ‘Edwardian’ to be not just the architecture between 1901 and 1910 but the exuberant and confident spirit which pervaded all the arts from the late Victorian period until the First World War. In music it is Elgar, in painting it is John Singer Sargent and in architecture it is a myriad of unknown practitioners whose creativity and skill would make the Baroque masters of Europe quake in their bucket top boots.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great architects of this period was Sir Alfred Waterhouse (1830- 1905) the architect of the Natural History Museum. He initially set up his practice in Manchester and put his stamp on the city with the Town Hall which was his first major commission. This he designed in Gothic style but as time went on, like his contemporary the painter Edward Millais he became more classical. His Refuge Assurance Building designed in partnership with his son Paul combines various styles from Baroque to Dutch Renaissance to make a building which feels surprisingly unified. It reminded me of Schinkel’s now demolished Bauakademie in Berlin, which similarly combines the warm reds and oranges of brick and terracotta. This colour palette is one of the distinctive features of Manchester architecture and can be seen on relatively modest buildings like the Salford Lads Club as well as the grandest buildings in the city. What gives this building an extra level of vibrancy is the use of green for the copper dome which is echoed in the window joinery and downpipes, particularly the downpipes which are one of the hallmarks of the superb attention to detail that can be seen in all of Waterhouse’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of visiting an unfamiliar city is that you inevitably come across brilliant architects you have never heard of. One such individual is the home-grown Mancunian Charles Heathcote (1851-1938) who designed prolifically in a Baroque style. His former Lloyds Bank at 53 King Street in white stone is an essay in shadow casting making the building like an inhabited sculpture. The free-standing ionic columns sit above a lower order of rustication which alternates between smooth and roughly hewn stone. This turns into smooth quoins which continue right up to the chimneys. The corner is beautifully resolved with a mini aedicule with sculpture above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also by Heathcote is the former National Westminster Bank in Spring Gardens, built from red sandstone. This, like his Lloyds Bank, makes a virtue of the corner but with a bold arched entrance door framed by octagonal piers and topped with a dome supported by paired ionic columns as buttresses on each corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just down the road from this is the Former Midland Bank by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Serine and white it sits proudly on King Street like the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or a formalised pyramid with its form breaking down and reducing as it ascends. Being both Classical and Art Deco it takes the form of many New York skyscrapers of the time with an ornate ground and top floor with simple windows on the intervening floors. The windows are set far back from the stone face of the wall which gives the building a massive and solid character. This contrasts with the thinness of the Doric pilasters on the ground floor which disappear into the rustication halfway up the shaft. For those who enjoy Sir Ned’s usual architectural tricks there is more than enough to keep you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this area there are a plethora of massive Baroque warehouses many of which were designed by Fairhurst. The detail, scale and ornamentation of these buildings is staggering. It makes me feel slightly frustrated that the current solution to warehousing is massive sheds which the owners are so ashamed of that they try to tone them in with the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further out of town is the Royal Infirmary on Oxford Road. Designed by Edwin Hall and John Brooke which was significantly opened by King Edward VII - a statue of the jovial king can be seen close by. I had not heard of either architect, although after a little research I discovered that Edwin Hall also designed Liberty &amp;amp; Co’s flagship store and I am very familiar with its Mock-Tudor façade just off Regent’s Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also walking in the outskirts of Manchester I came across Platt Hall, a Georgian country house by Carr of York which sits with its park almost oblivious to the urban sprawl that surrounds it. It is hard to image this estate within fields only a short carriage ride from Manchester. Although this house is by one of the giants of Georgian architecture, it seemed small fry compared to the confident Edwardian buildings of the city centre. There is an attitude in polite society that it you must like classical architecture make sure it’s the refined well-mannered Georgians. Edwardians are thought to be too vulgar, perhaps ‘criminally vulgar’ as Morrissey would say. But how can you not love their playfully unrestrained buildings? I am beginning to think that maybe these relatively unknown architects are the closest British architects come to the genius of Michelangelo and Borromini.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edwardian spirit held on in Manchester right until the Second World War, decades after King Edward’s death. The extension to the Town Hall and next to it the Pantheon like Central Library were both built in the 1930s and designed by Vincent Harris (1876- 1971). He was great classical architect who design numerous notable buildings including Sheffield City Hall, Leeds Civic Hall, The Ministry of Defence on Whitehall and Kensington Central Library. He was the last of an era yet somehow won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1951 despite substantial opposition from his modernist contemporaries. On accepting the award Harris is reported to have said: “Look, a lot of you here tonight don’t like what I do and I don’t like what a lot of you do …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/36.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/36.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the post war and current architecture is a disaster. It is a pity that Manchester could not continue with the style of Harris, Heathcote, and Fairhurst. It is quite possible to design new Edwardian style buildings, we have the craftsman and the expertise. I designed one of my own a few years ago as a replacement to Knightsbridge Barracks, unfortunately the design never came to fruition, but if an ambitions developer or maybe Mayor Andy Burman reads this and wants to get in touch, I would be happy to oblige. I will even do the first sketch pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 79e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 79e’ houses.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;--&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/01E.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in an intriguing hidden window which lights the alter from the side. This illuminates a carved marble base relief of the ecstatic body of St Francis, suspended in mid air by angels. The light, which seems to come from nowhere, would have seemed like a miracle to the original worshippers who would never have seen an electric light. To give this composition even more potency, the magical light is from the east and so would be seen as Divine. East light has been worshiped for millennia and in a pre-scientific age, when people were instinctively scared of the dark the coming of a new day would be seen as a gift from the gods. This pagan belief is ironically central to Christian theology. The line in Luke’s gospel ‘Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us’ illustrates this belief and this is why most European churches face east. It is not to face Jerusalem as I previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, this side chapel was full of scaffolding which no one seemed to be attending to. This was very useful, because it allowed me to measure high up details which would otherwise be in accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/04E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/04E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/03E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/03E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/05E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/05E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rainy Saturday I was happily measuring and I heard some organ music wafting in. Initially I thought it was just someone practicing, but when I peeped out I noticed that the church was packed with a wedding in full swing. I did not want to make a spectacle of myself so hid back in the chapel and carried on measuring. I then heard what I thought was the wedding ending so decided to make my move, but to my dismay it was the opening hymn for another wedding. It must have been peak season, because by the time I could get out tactfully I had witnessed three weddings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, in the same chapel, I was working quite late. A priest was completing some ceremonial hocus pocus over the alter, and when he saw me he rolled his eyes - perhaps thinking he would have to redo the complete ritual. A few minutes later he flicked the lights out and disappeared through a side door, which he angrily slammed behind him. I was now locked in an almost completely dark church with only the statues of Italian nobles and the relics of forgotten saints for company. I stumbled around trying to find a way out, crashing into pews and who knows what. Bearing in mind this was years before mobile phones existed and so I had neither the means to call anyone or the use of a torch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found the front door.  Fortunately it was bolted from the inside, so I undid the bolts and escaped, leaving the church with priceless works of art ready for the taking. I saw a carabiniere across the road and told him that the church was unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I would have tried to communicate using my hotel/restaurant level Italian, but I was so angry I just said &lt;em&gt;“The church over there is wide open, some priest locked me in.”&lt;/em&gt; He looked confused….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think anything was stolen - I never checked.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ornament Podcast</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the 20th century the addition of ornament to architecture was considered a crime. After several decades of dull unadorned buildings, architects and clients started to hunger for the decorative elements of bygone eras. This revival came as part of the postmodern movement during the 1980s. Since then the use of ornament has been more accepted but still viewed with suspicion by the modernist establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ornament was my way into architecture. When I started working for my father during school and university holidays it was ornament which was my primary role. I had an interest and a facility for it from an early age and I became know within the office for drawing out full size details of Corinthian capitals, keystones, swags, chimneypieces, decorative ceilings and anything which demanded ornament. My output was known humorously as ‘the pretties department’ - a label I initially found patronising as it seemed that the ‘proper architects’ were doing construction and running contracts and I, like a child, was quietly drawing frivolous and unnecessary decoration. But I grew to love the label as I started to understand the importance of ornament and for that matter, prettiness too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some images which I drew over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I chaired the Traditional Architecture Group’s first round table discussion and we chose ornament as the subject. As panellist’s we had Svante Helmbaek Tirén, a renowned architecture theorist with an interest in ornament and Sandy Stoddart, perhaps the greatest living figurative sculptor. The discussion covers many aspects of ornament in architecture with valuable contributions from Robert Adam, Hugh Petter and George Saumarez Smith. Due to the coronavirus we had to do this as a zoom discussion instead of live, which was a pity, but it did have the advantage that many people from far afield could join us which would not have been possible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fascinating discussion and we covered a whole variety of topics. The questions which we grappled with included:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why was the modern moment so hostile to ornament?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is ornament just about the play of light on a surface?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does ornament need to follow historic precedent?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does dirt on buildings affect ornament?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made this into a podcast which &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-365839898/interview-ornament&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can listened to by following this link&lt;/a&gt;, you are in for a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Versailles Redesigned</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Coronavirus turned the world upside down Miranda and I took our younger two children to see Versailles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bad saying this, but when I walked up to the front of Versailles I was struck by how unimpressive it was despite all the money spent on it. I do not want to sound negative, but I do feel it was a wasted opportunity. The palace itself seems too small in the context of all the outbuildings that it almost disappears. I later learnt that I am not the first person to make this observation, Jean-Baptiste Colbert a minister of finances during Louis XIV’s reign felt that his boss had turned Versailles into an ‘a little man with big arms and a large head’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden side is not much better. The palace façade monotonously repeats the same bay configuration with little variation for its whole quarter of a mile length. The silhouette is dull and the whole composition is lacking in drama or excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is remarkable that architects as great as Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart should have produced such an underwhelming building. ‘Come on lads, what went wrong?’ I feel compelled to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect the reason is twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Versailles is a series of massive additions to a relatively modest original chateau. The great architect Charles Perrault who was also a senior official in the Royal Building Office claimed that Louis kept the original building for sentimental reasons. Working in this ad hoc way requires great skill to ensure that the final building look right and even the king had his reservations. In letter of 1699, written by Louis XIV’s second wife, Madame de Maintenon, she revealed that her husband privately admitted that Versailles would have been better had he demolished the old chateau entirely before starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And secondly, Louis XVI was a control freak. He was fascinated by architecture and had regular meetings on Thursdays with his architects, an impressive commitment for a busy king. A hands-on client is great, but they do need to respect and listen their architect if they want the best results. This would have been hard for Louis who from birth was bought up to believe that he was quite literally a gift from god or ‘Dieudonné’, a name he evidently took to heart. I image that the great ideas of Le Vau and Manart’s were ignored and they ultimately just resorted to timidly pleasing their client rather that doing great architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned home and aided by the extra time which the coronavirus lockdown has generated, I set myself the task of redesigning Versailles.
For the front elevation to get over the problem of the diminutive central block I added a building to separate the Cour Royale from the Cour des Statues. In the middle of this block is a triumphal arch which frames the original chateau in the distance. By adding this building, the small scale of the centre of the palace is masked and give both courts a more pleasing proportion. The separation would also give a more interesting and varied arrive sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the garden elevation I propose adding a large central block to break the monotony and to make a more interesting silhouette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astute observer will notice that these designs have a certain dept to Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor. It did make me speculate what would have happened had Louis XIV beaten the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim. Perhaps he would have taken the first dukes’ architects and asked them to remodel Versailles. My light-hearted scribblings are a guess at what they might have produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;For this article I am indebted to Tony Spawforth's book *Versailles: A Biography of a Palace* and *Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King* by Antonia Fraser. Both excellent books which I can thoroughly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Francis Terry's Versailles Redesigned drawings take practitioner commended place in Eye Line 2020</title>

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry’s Versailles Redesigned drawings mix ‘bolshy arrogance’ and spectacular images to take practitioner commended place in Eye Line 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to love an entry that is titled ‘Versailles Redesigned’ and this, coupled with traditionalist architect Francis Terry’s great skill in draughting and colour wash, meant that it scored highly with all the judges. Though those seeing it as a top three contender were in a minority, these watercolours were always there in the discussion, as a kind of ground anchor….&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Country House in Northamptonshire</title>

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry and Associates are pleased that planning permission has been granted for a new country house in Northamptonshire. This is great news and shows that amongst all the confusion of the past few months things are moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house is based on the manor house tradition, using local iron stone with smooth ashlar architectural elements.&lt;/p&gt;
