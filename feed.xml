&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry and Associates are pleased that planning permission has been granted for a new country house in Northamptonshire. This is great news and shows that amongst all the confusion of the past few months things are moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house is based on the manor house tradition, using local iron stone with smooth ashlar architectural elements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lockdown is slowly being relaxed, more building sites are looking to return to productivity.  This is obviously problematic – from the restrictions of welfare facilities on sites to many trades trying to work around each other.  Is there a safer, easier to police way of building houses that would enable social distancing to be maintained whilst still being productive and efficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the Covid 19 crisis, housing is still a pressing issue and all the major political parties are keen to show how this problem may be solved. The government has set a target of building 300,000 homes a year by the middle of the next decade. Despite recent increases in activity, the volume of houses built is nowhere near this figure and the problem will only get worse. Policy makers are desperately trying to think of a new way to deliver more houses because the traditional methods of building are not delivering the volume required. Many people think that off-site methods are the only way of solving this problem. The perception is that it would be cheaper and quicker because it would avoid many of the problems of a traditional building site. Minimizing time on site has the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building sites must deal with unpredictable weather, including rain, wind, frost or even snow which slows and sometimes halts production. Working in a factory, the temperature can be controlled and working inside also eliminates the problem of rain, snow and wind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building sites are inherently dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less time on site means less disruption caused by noise, dust and extra local traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With skill shortages being a real problem on building sites, working off-site in a factory would help because the workers would not need to spend time travelling to different places and they could work in comfort. This would help to retain workers in the construction industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality control is easier to monitor in a factory rather than on a building site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these factors work together to make the houses cheaper and quicker to build. nHouse claims it can build a house in 20 days in the factory which can then be erected on site in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not in a hypothetical realm here, building houses in factories is already done in vast quantities. Predictably Japan and Germany are leading the way, but the U.K. has already started to embrace this new trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Booth writing in the Guardian (31/12/17) observed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One of Britain’s major housebuilders is to prefabricate up to a quarter of its homes in a factory, in the latest attempt by the construction industry to tackle the housing shortage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berkeley Homes, which builds 4,000 homes a year, is planning to create a facility in Kent next year where builders will work to produce up to 1,000 houses and apartments annually which will then be craned on to sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another company, nHouse, is setting up a factory in Peterborough with the capacity to build 400 homes a year, complete with light fittings, bathrooms, bookshelves and kitchens. Production is expected to start in January.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other developers, including Legal and General and Urban Splash, have launched prefab home divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionalists (like me) should not fear this development because prefabrication has been with us since classical times. There is substantial evidence that the Romans had standard column sizes which were used extensively throughout the empire. But a more critical question to ask is, can these prefabricated houses be beautiful? Beautiful boats, cars, bicycles, furniture, clothes, shoes, or whatever you care to mention, can be made in factories, and so why not houses? It can certainly be done in timber, the Americans have been building attractive prefabricated timber houses for years. To do this using heavy materials like brick is more complex but I believe quite possible. I have seen vast brick and stone wall panels for office buildings being made offsite and so I cannot see why this could not be done for housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build in volume, houses must be popular and tap into what most people find beautiful. The modernist style can be very beautiful, but it is not for everyone. Modern style buildings generally fall into the ‘marmite’ category, you either love them or you hate them. A popular house needs to be more general in its appeal. For this I would suggest that designing in the traditional style rather than a modern style is the answer. Every estate agent knows that it is far easier to sell a traditional style house than a modern one, Georgian properties being the most popular. This is backed up by the findings of a MORI poll of 2015 which demonstrates that people prefer traditional style houses to modern by a substantial margin. The traditional style houses for this survey were taken from Poundbury and are new build classical Georgian style properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of the Georgian style should come as no surprise. The Georgians took beauty seriously dedicating whole architectural treatises to the study of proportion and the recording of beautiful mouldings from ancient Greece and Rome. Modernism, by contrast came from a functionalist origin with the belief that beauty would result as a consequence of building well and fulfilling the brief. But as Robert Venturi and others have observed, the Vitruvian triad of commodity, firmness, and delight, (or in layman’s terms; function, structure and beauty) is not an equation. Function plus structure does not always equal beauty, each of the three needs to be considered separately and with equal seriousness. The simple Georgian terrace or house has embodied proportional theories which go back to Palladio and ultimately ancient Greece and Rome. This is why they are generally perceived to be beautiful and the reason why they are so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Georgian style and specifically classicism is particularly applicable to the current housing crisis because it was built in such a huge volume and at an incredible speed. Classicism was maintained throughout the Victorian era and up until the First World War. The developers of the 18th and 19th century wanted to build quickly and cheaply and so it is useful to see how they produced beautiful buildings within the same parameters. A striking feature of these buildings is the repetition of all architectural elements. This is as much true for Downing Street as a modest Georgian terrace anywhere in the country. The use of repeated elements makes the building process more efficient because it eliminates one-off items which are time consuming and costly to produce. There is a worry that even if beautiful Georgian style buildings could be made in a factory this would not be desirable as they would all be the same and none of the houses would have any individuality. I do not see this as a problem. I have recently designed a housing range for Halsbury Homes and we deliberately made all the houses look similar and I feel that the repetition gives the buildings better group value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where many new housing developments do wrong, at great expense developers make all the houses look different and the result is a very ‘noisy’ visual experience. The use of repetition has a calming effect on the eye because it does not need to process so much information. Georgian buildings are full of standard products made off-site, these include sash windows, doors, staircases, fireplaces, ceiling rosettes, cornicing and skirtings.  This means that reproducing Georgian architecture is well suited to off-site factory production and the Georgian builder would have happily prefabricated whole houses if it was possible at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Classical style which the Georgian and Victorian architects employed so well has been adapted to so many different materials and building methods. I feel sure that if house builders required classical style buildings to be made off-site in sufficient volume this could easily be done. The reason why so much off-site buildings are so hideous is because of the taste of the designers and that is where the problem lies. Many architects like to make their buildings look original and fear being ‘pastiche’. The definition of pastiche is ‘an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work, artist, or period’. For some reason architects always try to avoid being labelled in this way, but I feel that as with all art forms, the artist (or architect in this case) is part of a tradition stretching back thousands of years that evolves and develops over time. Generations of architects have tried to make beautiful buildings and it is worth benefiting from their knowledge. To avoid being pastiche is, in my opinion, the biggest stumbling block to the production of beautiful houses. It is a far greater obstacle than the engineering problem of producing beautiful houses off-site. If we can get to the moon and split the atom, the technical issues of making beautiful homes in a factory is well within our capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amor Fati - A Classical Attitude to Covid-19</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/amor-fati/01.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realise this, and you will find strength’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Emperor Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this pandemic, with people dying by the thousands and the feared possibility of a global recession of elephantine proportions, I could be criticised for nonchalantly blogging about the finer points of classical architecture. So, I felt it is time to write something relevant to this crisis and from the heart. I have decided to write about how I get through hard times, at least in theory, which you might find useful. I am slightly nervous about posting this, in fact I wrote the first version a while ago, posted it for a couple of days and then took it down. It did not seem the right time, but now certainly is. You can rest assured this is a one off, next month I will go back to discussing triglyphs and metopes in the normal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at stressful times like now when many people take comfort in religion, which is fine, but religion has never really worked for me. I was bought up as an evangelical Christian with the belief that if you were not a Christian in a limited and very specific way, you would literally burn in the fires of hell for all eternity after you died. Unsurprisingly I could not reconcile that with a loving god and far from giving me comfort it made me scared and unhappy. Over time I freed myself from these unpleasant thoughts and have now adopted Stoicism which for many reasons suits me well. It is a very positive philosophy and like many things that appeal to me, it is classical in origin and was even espoused by the great roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. He was himself a man who incidentally lived through Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoicism is also deeply ingrained into the British psyche, it’s the blitz mentality, it’s Nelson giving orders while dying at Trafalgar and now it is the nurses, like my sister Sophie, who risk their lives while cheerfully caring for the sick. This ‘stiff upper lip’ and ‘no nonsense’ way of getting through life appeals to my repressed public school nature particularly at a time when people seem to get offended by anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I take from Stoicism is the desire to love the hand fate has dealt you, whatever it is. I therefore try not to dwell on things I can not change but instead embrace all the things I can effect with enthusiasm, energy and resourcefulness. ‘Great in theory’ you may say and I’d agree, it does not always work, but it’s an aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same attitude was shared by the great stoic Epictetus who said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Don’t seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/amor-fati/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amor Fati - A Classical Attitude to Covid-19&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of self help books and religions focus on happiness; I feel this is a mistake. Happiness needs to be earned and it is never a permanent state. Who, apart from someone either very stupid or those oblivious to the suffering in the world around them could be happy the whole time? In evolutionary terms the complacency of happiness is dangerous, anxiety is far more useful. A while ago I was at a wedding and I heard a sermon that really stuck in my mind. The preacher made an argument which rested on the assumption that animals are happy in their natural state. ‘Has this man ever watched David Attenborough?’ I thought to myself. I am no zoologist, but from my limited knowledge, life for animals in the wild is anything but happy. Think of the zebra on an African plane, they are constantly looking around fearful of a lion appearing from nowhere and ripping them apart, limb from limb, while still alive. This would be an extremely painful death, which brings to mind the worst of medieval torture. This way of dying is a common occurrence for a zebra, and it is probably happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zebra who wakes up in the morning and thinks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…..life is wonderful, how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful part of the world, blue sky…..again! Why are you lot looking around all the time, the lions won’t bother us today, don’t be so pessimistic. Relax enjoy yourself….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zebra do not think like this for the simple reason that all those zebras are dead. They are what is known in lion circles as ‘low lying fruit’. This is why all zebras who live to any age are constantly worried about their imminent death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not feel any less sorry for the lions, they have to catch these zebras who are impossibly quick and if the lion does not catch any for a while he or she will be too weak to chase them and so die of starvation. What does the zebra and the lion get out of life? Is their life worth living or are we doing them all a favour by bringing them all to the brink of extinction? ….I would argue not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche asking a similar question with this theory of eternal returns. The question he posed was, would you, with all the suffering of your own life, live it all over again exactly the same. The answer must be a resounding loud YES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the struggle, not happiness, which gives life its vivid and colourful intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘It’s easy for you to say that’&lt;/em&gt; you may feel, and that’s true. I come from a privileged background and so I really know nothing of suffering to any great extent. But don’t take it from me, take it from Seneca who suffered more than most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent—no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, Stoics will not waste time wishing Covid-19 did not exist or worrying about the consequential recession. Instead they would focus on what they can change, which is to protect themselves and their families, help the vulnerable and use this down time productively. These hard times are an opportunity to reflect and build resistance so hopefully coming out the other side an emotionally stronger and better person who makes the most of this amazingly beautiful, joyous yet terrifying world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any crafter will know, starting a project is one thing – finishing it is something totally different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Francis Terry and his family the lockdown has meant a project which was started in February has become a real focus for quality time together, and as well as being admired by many of Francis’s followers via social media, it was picked up by Architectural Digest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/this-english-family-is-painting-its-way-through-the-pandemic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who ran this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope it inspires you to start (and complete) something creative if you find yourself with more time during this lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have experienced boredom to some extent or other during this lockdown. You may have noticed that Francis Terry has been overcoming this by trying different drawing styles (see the April blog – &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/how-to-draw-like-raphael/&quot; alt=&quot;How to Draw Like Raphael&quot;&gt;How to Draw Like Raphael&lt;/a&gt;).  Another new string to his bow has been uploading his first podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Francis is interviewed by his son, and the nuggets of wisdom they discuss include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was the best classical architect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s important about classical architecture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Gothic architecture so appealing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis hopes to create more podcasts to entertain himself – and hopefully you – over the coming months. Please feel free to use the social media links at the bottom of the website to message us with suggestions for future talks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Draw like Raphael</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/how-to-draw-like-raphael/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/how-to-draw-like-raphael/thumbs/01F.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Draw like Raphael&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today exactly five hundred years ago Raphael, the great renaissance artist, died. His body was laid to rest in the Pantheon, perhaps the most sacred and important place in Rome. His mistress, Margarita Luti , was barred from attending the funeral and Maria Bibbiena, his fiancé of convenience was later buried beside him. The day of his death was allegedly his birthday and also Good Friday. The symmetry of Raphael dying on the day of his birth would not be lost on the minds of renaissance intellectuals with their love of clean, pure numbers, harmonic ratios and proportions. Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ died would also have significance and was one of the many parallels drawn between the two. Like Jesus, despite his early death and relatively short career, Raphael’s influence over all subsequent generations is hard to underestimate. Rembrandt, Renoir and Picasso all borrowed directly from him, not to mention the whole tradition of western academic painting. Even the PreRaphaelites who formed in opposition to his work, could not help using is name to define themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raphael also represents a fault line, a B.C./A.D. moment in the chapters of art history books. He, along with Michelangelo and Leonard da Vinci, became the heroes of the high renaissance which was perhaps the greatest moment of creativity the western world will ever see. The youthful and charming Raphael found himself at the center of this vortex and his death heralded the end of a golden age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest praise one can give an artist is to say he or she draws like Raphael. It comes in the same package as writing like Shakespeare or ‘bending it like Beckham’. As I can’t write poetry and don’t play football the latter two challenges are not open to me, but drawing like Raphael… how hard can it be? Picasso arrogantly said he drew like Raphael from childhood. But how good were Raphael’s drawings? Perhaps Picasso picked an easy target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below shows my attempt and I admit it was harder than the spontaneous lines of Raphael suggest. During this time stuck at home you may like to have a go yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy drawing and stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Introduction to British Architecture from Queen Victoria to George VI</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/british-architecture-from-queen-victoria-to-george-vi/social.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/british-architecture-from-queen-victoria-to-george-vi/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An Introduction to British Architecture from Queen Victoria to George VI&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog this month is two in-house lectures I have given to my office over the past few weeks. Originally, I intended to cover the period from Queen Victoria to World War II in one lecture. But unsurprisingly this proved impossible and so the first is Victorian and Edwardian Architecture and the second is English architecture between the Wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-1-an-introduction-to-victorian-and-edwardian-architecture&quot;&gt;Lecture 1: An Introduction to Victorian and Edwardian Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2Of8pGvOzY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Victorian age inherited the battle of styles which defined the end of the Georgian era, a battle which was not convincingly won by either side. Gothic, Classical and even Mughal style architecture were all available to patrons and architects. To the serious-minded Victorian this was all too whimsical and they searched for a style which would be appropriate for their times so that the others could be dismissed. The chosen style was Gothic, and theorists were not shy of giving this stylistic preference a moral dimension. Pugin was the first to do this in his book ‘Contrasts’ where he compares the morally bankrupt world of classical Georgian England with a romantic view of medieval England which he saw as a golden age both socially and architecturally. John Ruskin followed these ideas returning from Venice with seductive sketches of Gothic and Byzantine details which he contrasted with the repetitive and mechanical nature of Georgian speculative housing. Gothic began to be seen as ‘true’, morally upright and Christian, while Classicism was seen as false, immoral and pagan. William Morris took these same ideas and reproduced them in wallpaper, stained glass and furniture. Because of this many of the greatest and most ambitious buildings of the Victorian age, including The Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge and the Natural History Museum were all designed in the gothic style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this ideological push for Gothic, Classicism persisted throughout the Victorian age on a scale never dreamed of by the Georgians and rivalling the great works of Ancient Rome. The Albert Hall, Leeds Town Hall and St George’s Hall, Liverpool are all evidence of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classical undercurrent grew into the dominant and triumphant style of Edwardian Baroque during the early years of the 20th century. The confidence of classicism suited the times and as John Singer Sargent represented the glamour of the age in virtuoso brush strokes, Lutyens, Belcher and Bloomfield captured the times in brick, marble and stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lecture-2-an-introduction-to-british-architecture-between-the-wars&quot;&gt;Lecture 2 An Introduction to British Architecture between the Wars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ADD3lecPAM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine the decimation caused by the First World War. Understandably, a growing number of people started to feel that there was something terribly wrong with a civilisation which caused young boys from neighbouring countries to commit murder for a purpose that no one really knew or understood. Politics, religion and art were now seen as culpable. A full-scale rejection of traditional values ensued, first by the Avant Garde and then slowly but surely by the population at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In art this started with the Italian Futurist Marinetti. His desire was to wipe away all forms of tradition and live in a brave new modern world of machines and speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Destroy the Museums. Crack syntax. Sabotage the adjective. Leave nothing but the verb.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas were taken up by Marcel Duchamp who in 1926 called a urinal a work of art, signing it R.Mutt, the French equivalent of Joe Bloggs. By titling it ‘fountain’ and placing this crude object in a refined art gallery in a position one would expect a Canova or Bernini he was deliberately mocking the great works of the past and in so doing attempting to free society from their hold. Le Corbusier and Gropius took these ideas into architecture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these revolutionary views also came a disdain for ornament. The architect Adolf Loos published an essay titled ‘Ornament and Crime’ where he suggests that the amount of ornament a society uses is inversely proportion to its level of civilisation. Primitive tribes ornament everything, their canoes, oars and themselves with tattoos. As we progress, he argues, our need for ornament diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all these ideas being in the air in mainland Europe, they made little impact on English architecture. Things continued as they were, although in a more chaste manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Second World War modernism came to dominate almost all British architecture. In Warsaw the damage caused by bombing was replaced by a faithful copy of what was there before but in London a different approach was used. Instead of replacing like for like, overtly modernist buildings were built and the taste for modernism was so strong that tower blocks were built out of choice instead of traditional terraces. The architectural establishment and successive political leaders saw modernism as the solution to the problems of the day. With the exception of a few cases like Clough Williams Ellis’s Port Meriam and Steven Dykes Bower’s Baldacchino at St Paul’s, Classical architecture was all but wiped out and would not return for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Life in Sketchbooks</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a collection of my own sketch books going back forty years. These are like a visual diary and they chart my various artistic and architectural interests over the years. Architecture has always been a constant theme but interspersed with drawings of people on trains, ideas for illustrated books, stage sets, life drawings, preliminary sketches for paintings and the occasional shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My earliest sketch books were canvas bound bought from Senelier’s on Quai Voltaire, Paris. These were given to me by my father and I filled them with a variety of subjects ranging from still-lifes, to pop stars to surrealist compositions - I loved Salvador Dali in those days. There are quite a few watercolours of classical buildings in Italy. My father and I regularly sketched together, and I have written about this previously &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/sketching-with-my-father/&quot; class=&quot;post-link&quot; alt=&quot;Sketching with my Father&quot;&gt;which can be seen here&lt;/a&gt;. I had a technique for these watercolours starting with pencil, then ink then watercolour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the time when I really learnt to draw, at the beginning of the ‘80 my drawings were perhaps charming if a little naive. Over the course of the decade this transformed into my mature style which is still how I draw – more or less. Some of my sketchbooks are partly diaries. They are unbearably self-conscious, but here I am writing a blog about it decades later - start as you mean to go on, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late ‘80 I had a sketchbook with a marbled cover, this I imagine was bought in Venice where shops full of marbled knickknacks are on every street corner. The first sketches in this book are watercolours - unsurprisingly of Venice. I was by now moving away from my tried and tested pen and ink with watercolour technique and starting to use watercolour by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/11.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/12.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/15.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in this book there are pen and ink lecture notes from my first year at Cambridge. I must have written these before I had made any friends and happily this swottyness was soon abandoned. Despite the acres of hours wasted studying architecture, our first-year lecture course was excellent and gave me a basic knowledge of the whole history of European architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ‘91 I had a year off after my graduation and went to live in Rome for several months, staying at the British School. I spent days drawing sculpture and architecture which was a blissful existence. One of my preferred places was the Villa Borghese which was only a short walk from the British School, it was also very quiet and importantly - free, unlike a lot of galleries in Rome. I spent days or more like weeks sketching the amazing collection of Bernini’s sculpture. When not there, I wondered around Rome sketching and measuring details that caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when I lived in Rome a friend from Rhode Island School of Design made me two beautiful sketch books from scratch. They both had a Japanese binding so that each page was an independent sheet rather than having the pages folded in half like a conventional book. One of these books I promptly lost but the other I still have, and it went everywhere with me, including Sicily, India and Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-90s I rented a studio which I used for painting in my spare time. At that time, I kept a sketch book in my studio and used it to try out ideas for paintings and compositions. Although these books contain some of the worst drawings, they were a means to an end, and this is probably the most authentic type of sketch book. This approach was probably influenced by an exhibition of Picasso’s sketch books at the Royal Academy which I saw many years ago. On his death, Picasso left some 175 sketchbooks spanning over 60 years, their pages filled with drawings of varying quality which were a testament to his extraordinary talent. It was fascinating seeing these sketches showing his working method and experiments from every period of his life. These drawings gave his work a validity that I felt I could not reasonably question and though I am not a fan, you could not deny his creative energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have come to feel that the whole notion of a spontaneous sketch book is a bit fake. Inspiration does not generally take you when you have your sketch book and art materials at hand - like taking a dog for a walk in a town and forgetting to bring poo bags - you never know when the clogs will start turning. Inspiration happens unpredictability and the cliched ‘back of a fag packet’ is a more likely place for an inspired sketch to be wrought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the late ‘90s, for a few years I attended a life drawing class on a weekly basis. It was in a friend’s studio and a group of about five or six of us hired a model for a day. We did rapid sketches and long poses, it was intense but very enjoyable. I would come back with dozens of drawing or paintings each time, the drawings below are some quick poses all done on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of having children and reading them bedtime stories, I became fascinated by illustrated books. Doctor Seuss, Maurice Sendak and E.H.Shepard replaced Raphael, Velazquez and Caravaggio in my affections. I completed an illustrated book about the Pied Piper of Hamelin in which instead of stealing all the children, he negotiates a solution with the mayor. Though it was a well-intentioned idea, it was deadly dull. Children aren’t born woke, they have it thrust upon them. They love pain, injustice and horror. Therefore, this sanitized version of the story just didn’t cut it. Had the Piper tortured the children in his cave, I might have had a success on my hands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000’s I had a sketch book in which I wanted to record the more memorable details I had worked on over the years. These included capitals, ornate ceilings, fireplaces and so on. I made a start but like most big plans that are not essential, they start well but never get finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent sketch book is an A5 Moleskin notebook with quite thin cream coloured paper. This has all sorts of things in it, perhaps most significantly two sketches for the Chelsea Barrack counter proposal which successfully derailed Richard Roger’s hideous scheme for that site.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/a-life-in-sketchbooks/thumbs/76.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Life in Sketchbooks&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That black sketch book is pretty much the last sketch book I have done, and it is about ten years old. Though I seem to spend more time sketching and painting than I have ever done, I prefer to use loose pieces of paper which are easier to handle, particularly for scanning and photocopying, and so now rarely use sketch books, if at all. As well as this, I find sketchbooks constraining and sometimes intimidating. How hard it is to draw spontaneously in the first page of an expensive book full of blank white pages. Also, if I do a really good sketch, I want to rip it out to give someone as a Christmas present or, conversely, if I do a poor drawing I want to rip it out so no one ever sees it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, should a sketch book be a bound collection of beautiful drawings, not quite worth framing but worth keeping for their group value or should they be experimental with the many failures kept alongside the few successes? I never really resolved this tension, and significantly nor has the ‘A’ level or GCSE syllabus. When studying art nowadays, instead of drawing still-lifes, pupils have to produce a ‘sketch book’ which tries to ride these opposing horses while fulfilling the criteria of a complex and prescriptive syllabus, a tough challenge for any aspiring artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem with sketch books is they can also be easily lost, and it is so much worse losing a whole collection than a single drawing. In a sketch book which had a space marked out in the front for a name and address which I dutifully filled in, there was a further line that said ‘reward if lost’ and a figure with a ‘£’ sign next to it. To avoid friends and colleagues hiding the sketch book and then demanding the ransom, instead of writing a figure I pompously wrote ‘the satisfaction of doing the right thing’. As fate would have it, I did actually leave this sketch book on a train and proving my suspicion that most people are essentially good, I was contacted by a kind stranger a few days later who sent my book back and only wanted to be reimbursed for the postage. That was fortunate, but I did lose one sketch book on a country house tour in Derbyshire which I never found again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the drawbacks of sketch books, they do have a compelling allure which is hard to underestimate. There is nothing quite like tactile sensation of leafing through an artist’s sketch book. Paintings in an exhibition can be enjoyed by many people at the same time, but with a sketch book, you, and only you, have the intimate pleasure of hearing the machinery of an artist’s mind whirring away from the comfort of an arm chair. And when the book is shut the music stops, until someone else opens it and the magic starts all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sutton Estate – Saved!</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/drawings/20190215.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2020/01/thumbs/22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proposed alterations to the Sutton Estate, Chelsea by Francis Terry, 2018.&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in February we reported how Francis Terry had been working with Create Streets and Save the Sutton Estate on their campaign to stop the demolition of the estate in Chelsea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This campaign was created in response to a planning application submitted by Affinity Sutton (now Clarion) in 2015 which looked to reduce both the number of social housing homes and the overall number of homes on the estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to share the news that Clarion Housing have now decided to refurbish, rather than demolish, many of the flats and bring them back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They made the following announcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Clarion Housing Group, the UK’s largest affordable housing provider, has today committed to a £37 million investment package to improve the entire Sutton Estate and deliver at least 80 new social rented homes to Kensington and Chelsea.  The plans, which will be developed with residents, will see the 106 year-old homes in blocks A-D (currently empty as they do not meet decency standards for accommodation) undergo a full refurbishment. All of the new homes will be for social rent and priority will be given to residents currently living on the estate.  Residents in the remaining 303 flats on the estate, blocks E-K &amp;amp; N-O, will benefit from new kitchens and bathrooms and other upgrades. Clarion has also committed to improving the outdoor spaces. The new scheme has no homes for private sale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2020/01/23.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2020/01/thumbs/23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sutton Estate – Saved!&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic result for all who campaigned against the original plans, which included 
demolishing 13 of the Sutton Estate’s 15 mansion blocks, reducing the amount of flats and selling over 100 to private buyers.  Local residents and supporters across London criticised the plan which would have seen the needless destruction of Edwardian buildings and a loss of 
affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our congratulations go to SOS (Save Our Sutton), with whom we worked on feasibility studies for alternative approaches during and after co-design workshops.  We hope the strong sense of community they have already shown continues to thrive, and wish them all the best in the improvements to their homes and living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.
