	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Tapestry Drawing Room at Castle Howard is a completely new architectural treatment to a room which was destroyed by fire in 1940. The room had been left as an empty shell of charred stonework ever since. The brief was to restore the room to what Vanbrugh would have done and incorporate the four Vanderbank tapestries which were designed and woven for the room in 1706.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-04.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-05.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architect Francis Terry worked in collaboration with interior designers Alec Cobbe and Remy Renzullo to realise this vision. The focus of the design is a baroque chimneypiece made from scagliola with an elaborate overmantel, framing a painting of the ‘Judgement of Paris’. A large entablature crowns the room with a decorative rinceau design in the frieze. The two doors have overdoor paintings depicting the life of Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-06.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-07.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care has been taken to use traditional materials and techniques where possible. All architectural elements of the project were hand drawn by Francis Terry at full size.  Unusually, the room uses onsite run plasterwork made in the traditional way, rather than fibrous plaster made off site which is conventionally used. The frieze of the fireplace has a head of Pluto framed by a cartouche which was carved by hand from limewood. The room is painted a dark blue to bring out the colours of the much-faded tapestries. In keeping with the baroque spirit, the decoration is extensively gilded.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in the room, apart from the antiques, paintings, and tapestries, was made in the UK within the past eighteen months. The crafts used for this room include: - hand carved timber classical ornament, traditional run plasterwork, scagliola manufacture and gilding. The craftsmanship is truly outstanding, and it is a joy to see that the UK is still world leaders in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five Classical Orders</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportions and defining features of the five orders of columns are a fundamental part of classical architecture. In this video, Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE delve deep into this cornerstone of the profession. From the rustic undecorated Tuscan order to the detailed and ornate Composite, they reflect on their usage over the years, their rich symbolism as well as the mysterious question of their distant origins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quinlan Terry's Life in Architecture</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr9Z1rpsfek&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is an interview between Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE, discussing the many unforgettable moments in his highly successful sixty-year career. His life has seen classical and traditional architecture change from being derided as a joke and even immoral in the ‘50s and ‘60s, to its adoption by Prince Charles and the Post-Modern movement in the ‘80s, and now its total acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as an investigation into these broad cultural trends, Quinlan recounts many of the amusing anecdotes that punctuated his career: these include, working with Profumo during the scandal, collaborating with Sir Anthony Blunt on researching Renaissance architecture, and being in Libya measuring Roman ruins at the time of the Gaddafi coup d’état.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a broad variety of topics discussed, this interview will interest architects and non-architects alike.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission for a New Seven Unit Apartment Scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge Has Been Granted</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/hans-place-12-24.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Planning Permission for a New Seven Unit Apartment Scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge Has Been Granted&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to be part of a team which have been granted planning consent for a new seven unit apartment scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge. The new building replaces a modernist style house built in the 1960s, which is unsympathetic to the area both in terms of materials and architectural language. The new design follows the dominant style of the square which consists of highly ornate red brick facades with brown stone and terracotta elements, using a classical style borrowed from diverse sources, including 17th century Dutch and Queen Anne influences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission Granted for a New House in Surrey</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our design for a new house in Surrey has been given planning permission by Waverley Borough Council. The design reflects local architectural characteristics with the use of stone and red brick, with a clay tile roof. The architectural detailing owes much to the Surrey vernacular and the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens who practiced extensively in the area. The planning submission was coordinated by Janet Long of Planit Consulting and the landscape design was by Nick Tripp of Taylor Tripp.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our design for a new house in Hampshire has been given planning permission by South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA). This scheme is particularly exciting as the site was originally laid out by Charles Bridgeman, one of the greatest English landscape designers of the 18th century. The house is designed in the classical style but subtly adapted to fulfil the functional requirements of modern family life. The materials used include brick, stone and flint which reflect local architectural character. The scheme was project managed by Finchatton, the landscape designer was Christian Sweet of Coulson Stone, and the planning consultant was Scot Masker of Masker Architects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Francis Terry’s Scheme for the Roman Circus in Colchester</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/roman-circus-10-24.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Francis Terry’s Scheme for the Roman Circus in Colchester&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2024/thumbs/roman-circus-10-24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Francis Terry’s Scheme for the Roman Circus in Colchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Roman chariot racing track (circus) was recently discovered to the south of Colchester city centre. This had gone unnoticed for nearly two thousand years because no actual building material was above ground. It is the only one of its kind in northern Europe and bears witness to the huge significance of Colchester during Roman times. To celebrate this discovery, Francis Terry has designed a proposal to surround the original racetrack with terraced housing and rebuild the original starting gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/roman-circus-2-10-24.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Francis Terry’s Scheme for the Roman Circus in Colchester&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2024/thumbs/roman-circus-2-10-24.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Francis Terry’s Scheme for the Roman Circus in Colchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are his thoughts on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, a Roman chariot racing track was discovered to the south of Colchester city centre. This had gone unnoticed for nearly two thousand years because no actual building material was above ground. Following the end of the Roman occupation of Britain, stone and brick from the site was taken and reused for building Medieval Colchester. The result is that virtually no material remains on the site at all, even much of the foundations have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its day this would have been a structure of national importance, perhaps the only one of its type in the country. Constructed in around 125AD, possibly under the orders of Emperor Hadrian, who was the man responsible for some of the most celebrated works of architecture of all history including, the Pantheon, Castel Sant’ Angelo and Hadrian’s Villa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in this site back in 2010 when I joined a campaign to buy the Sergeants Mess which sits at the west end of the circus. It was felt that this would make an excellent visitors’ centre as it would have the site of the starting gates within its garden. Unfortunately, this did not happen due to lack of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I revisited the site in 2023 and saw the current interpretation of the starting gates which consists of ten recently built brick piers, all about 3 ft high, which show the position of where the starting gates once were. Though I salute the effort in creating these brick and stone piers, they have not gone far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then thought of the simple idea of rebuilding the starting gates in their entirety, in their original position using the same materials the Romans used and the same construction method. As a classical architect I am familiar with Roman construction, rules of classical proportion and the practical use of load bearing brick and stone structures. So, I drew out what I imagined the starting gates would look like. With my experience and knowledge of Roman architecture I came up with a plausible design. This was no great work of genius as loadbearing masonry construction with the use of brick and stone, the design becomes the inevitable consequence of these factors. I can be very sure the starting gates look similar to this, although there is no record of their structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these drawings I asked a stone mason to provide a price to carry out the work. He came back with a detailed breakdown which put the price at £2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now in the position of trying to get the necessary funds to start the rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that this venture is hugely important to the future of Colchester. With the problems facing town and city centres with shopping going online, the built heritage becomes increasingly important to keep these places vibrant and active. We have an opportunity to give both locals and tourists something to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Germany flattened Warsaw during the war, the attitude was to rebuild it as close as possible to what it had been. Where photographic evidence was missing, they used the 18th century paintings of Bernardo Bellotto to fill the gaps and, at times improve what had been. This creative rebuilding programme was an important act to give the people of Warsaw a feeling of belonging and civic pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colchester was a town of immense importance during the Roman period. It was to Colchester that the Emperor Claudius came all the way from Rome (possibly on Elephants) to receive the surrender of the British tribal chiefs. At the time of Vesuvius’s eruption, the population of Pompeii was 10 to 20,000, Colchester at its height had a population of 30,000. It is an understatement that the significance of this history is not matched by what can be seen of Roman Colchester. My hope is that by rebuilding the starting gates, a unique Roman monument can be revived, and I look forward to seeing the great benefits which will come from this endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>M&amp;S Flagship Store Demolition Alternative Proposal</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;video-wrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; playsinline=&quot;&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry in collaboration with Create Streets have designed an alternative proposal to the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer’s proposed total demolition of their historic store in Oxford Street. Robert Kwolek has written about it in The Sunday Times here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marks and Spencer’s proposal to demolish their 1930 Oxford Street flagship store (Orchard House) has proved very controversial with a government call in, an appeal to the High Court and high-profile interventions from (among others) Kevin McCloud, Griff Rhys Jones, Sir Simon Jenkins and Kristin Scott Thomas as well as a host of experts from the worlds of architecture, heritage and planning. It has served as a prominent cause célèbre for important interrelated debates about net zero development, the future of department stores, twentieth century heritage and high streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future for Orchard House is once more in doubt following the March 2024 High Court decision. The Secretary of State had turned down the planning application, but the High Court has upheld a judicial review of the rejected planning permission. The only grounds on which the Secretary of State’s refusal was not overturned was his approach to the store’s sensitive heritage setting. However, this is not the end of the story. The Secretary of State now needs to redetermine the appeal. He could, in theory, still refuse planning permission. What will the Secretary of State, whomever that may be, do after the general election?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more sustainable and better path is possible. Trade offs are inevitable between the viability of the site, its heritage, its uses, its embodied carbon, ongoing sustainability and the quality, beauty and future of Oxford Street. Nevertheless, Create Streets believes that an approach which sought to reuse more of the existing building and was less dismissive of the existing setting would have been wiser, less costly for Marks and Spencer and more popular with the wider public. Working with the internationally significant classical architect, Francis Terry, we have therefore worked up an alternative proposal which;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;text-list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creates a comparable volume of overall development to ensure viability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Could be built to a broadly comparable cost&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Accepts some demolition whilst saving what can be saved&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encloses the street more fittingly and elegantly to Oxford Street’s long-term benefit&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creates an improved new public space at Granville Place&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creates elegant public arcades through the site&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creates a development in which it would be possible to create homes as well as offices and shops&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creates a better street with a raised crossing and street trees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach is much more popular with the general public and this something we can agree on. In a national opinion poll conducted by Deltapoll in February 2024,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;text-list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The British public overwhelmingly preferred our design by 79 per cent to 17 per cent&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This preference transcends politics. Voters for all three main British parties strongly preferred our design with Liberal Democrat voters being closest to the national average (80 vs 15 per cent for Liberal Democrat voters; 76 vs 20 per cent for Labour voters and 83 vs 14 per cent for Conservative voters)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This preference transcends views on Europe. Views on the design from “remain” and “leave” voters were almost identical. (80 vs 15 per cent for “remain” voters and 80 vs 17 per cent for “leave” voters)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A preference that is shared by rich and poor. Those of ABC1 social status and of C2DE social status both strongly prefer our design. (82 vs. 15 per cent for ABC1 and 75 vs. 21 per cent for C2DE)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A preference that is shared everywhere. Respondents in every British region strongly preferred our design with the highest support in the South of England (83 vs. 13 per cent) and Scotland (83 per cent vs 15 per cent) and the lowest in Wales (71 vs 26 per cent)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A preference of old and young. Clear majorities of all age groups preferred our design though with support slightly increasing with age. (75 vs 23 per cent for those aged 18-24 and 83 vs. 12 per cent for those aged over 65)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission Granted for a New House Within the Blenheim Estate</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our new house in the grounds of Blenheim Palace has been granted planning permission. This is a particularly prestigious consent as the house is within a Grade 1 listed landscape and on a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The standard required by UNESCO, Historic England and West Oxford District Council is understandably of the highest level. We are therefore honoured to be the architects for such a significant consent. The Country House expert Jeremy Musson commended the design in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
	“The proposed house will become the comfortable and elegant centrepiece of an enclosed and inhabited grove within the wider story of Blenheim – another chapter in the unfolding Marlborough/Spencer-Churchill story and is designed as the permanent and future residence of the Marquis and Marchioness of Blandford, their family and successors.”
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
