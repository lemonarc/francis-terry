        <title>The Haywain by John Constable</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Haywain by John Constable&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain by John Constable, is perhaps the most famous English painting. Painted exactly two hundred years ago, the scene depicts Flatford in Suffolk which I know well as it is only a few miles from where I live and I often take my little West Highland Terrier out for walks in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/social.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the left of the Haywain is a cottage know as Willy Lott’s House. This was owned by a tenant farmer of that name in Constable’s time. It has not changed much in the intervening years thanks to carefully maintenance by the National Trust. Behind Constable’s viewpoint is Flatford Mill which was owned by the painter’s father and gave him sufficient wealth to contemplate being an artist rather than working on the land. This is a charming collection of buildings despite being built with utility rather than aesthetic in mind. There is very little self-conscious architecture to be seen apart from a Gibbsian entrance door which is shoehorned into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain has been reproduced on countless mugs, tea towels, jigsaws and postcards all over the world. This notoriety has made Willy Lott’s House, despite its small scale, the most famous house in the country, more widely recognised than Chatsworth, Castle Howard or Blenheim. In fact, it may well be the most famous house in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable depicts Willy Lott’s House as a harmonious part of the whole scene, as natural as the trees, the mill pond and the clouds. Willy Lott, according to legend had never been outside his own horizon and the materials that built his house were similar. The timber framed structure was made from trees which grew nearby; the lime for the rendered walls would have been found in local fields and the clay for the bricks and tiles for the foundations, chimneys and roof would have been dug up and fired in a makeshift kiln close to the site. This house therefore was not an outside intervention but simply made up of the materials from the landscape rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Constable painted this picture, it was seen as a surprising subject for such a large scale of painting. At the time, paintings of this size and ambition would depict a biblical or historical narrative designed for the elevation and improvement of the viewer. To paint a simple landscape with a cottage and a cart in a mill pond was not nearly heroic enough. Earlier artists would have replaced Willy Lott’s house with a classical temple in the manner of Poussin or Claude Lorraine and maybe the haywain with Apollo’s chariot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/12.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable was part of a shift towards a love of simple country pleasures in the world that was becoming increasingly urbanised, frightening and complex. The countryside which until his time was viewed as a place of toil where crops could be harvested and animals fattened at huge personal cost and endless hours of hard and often tedious work. As agricultural methods made farming more efficient, more people gradually became freer from the onerous labour and unpredictability of farming. Agriculture could then be appreciated from a distance with nostalgic affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new love of all things rural started with the most privileged and then permeated down to the middle classes. The first time this movement became a piece of architecture was with Marie Antoinette and her little hamlet, the ‘Hameau de la Reine’ built for her at Versailles. Here she would milk cows, feed chickens and tend sheep like a shepherdess from a toile de jouy illustration. At the time it must seemed an eccentric pastime for the Queen of France but this ill-fated and misunderstood monarch must have found it a welcome escape from the stifling formality and precarious nature of Louis XVI court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English caught on to this fashion during the mid 18th century and it became one of the many styles they adopted along with Chinese, Turkish and Gothic. The cottage style or cottage ornée as it was commonly known started a fashion which has continued in an almost unbroken line down to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/17.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of architecture hypnotised the Victorian era with their nostalgia for a golden age of rural bliss before the gruelling cruel realities of the industrial revolution. This led to the Arts and Crafts movement where the cottage and the vernacular approach became the favourite style of many architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens being the most famous exponent designed dozens of cottage style houses throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/18.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/19.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English love of cottages continued into the 20th century, and when the heroes came back from the First World War the simple cottage within its own garden was seen as a fitting reward for their labour. This led to the extensive interwar suburbs that surround most English towns and cities having houses that refer to cottage architecture in their detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love of the simple rural life which inspired Marie Antoinette, has come down to us through the eyes of Constable, Lutyens and their followers. Although the French queen’s invented world at Hameau with it’s porcelain milking buckets have been replaced by cheese making rock stars and fiercely protected rural landscapes, there is a love of the simple rural life which touches the souls of each and every one of us. Constable’s depiction illustrates the harmonious partnership between the body of man, the body of animals and the body of the earth, as the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva would describe it. This is mankind as part of nature and not separate to it. Now, in these environmentally conscious times this should strike a chord in everyone’s hearts, making the Haywain not only one of the most loved paintings but also one of the most relevant to grow from English soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/20.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I did a short podcast with my son Alfie. We talked about many things, but to kick off we discussed the romantic view of beauty in which artists aimed to ‘stun’ and not necessarily please. This led on to a conversation about the rock band Joy Division and we wrestled with the question that if architecture is ‘frozen music’, as Goethe suggests, what sort of music should architects play. Follow the link below to hear the whole discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;townley-2-3&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;townley-1-3&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/02a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite houses is Townley Hall in in County Louth, Ireland. It is not open to the public but the institution that owns it are happy for enthusiasts to look round, which I did a many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley shares the classic rise and fall of many Irish country houses. The estate had belonged to the Townley family since Cromwellian times. Passing through various sons and nephews, it was Blayney Townley Balfour who in 1794 commissioned Francis Johnston to design the present house. The family owned it until 1957 and then it passed through various hands until eventually it was bought in the 1980s by its current owner, the School of Philosophy and Economic Science, who use it as a residential study centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley’s plan follows the classic ‘noughts and crosses’ form with a circular staircase hall in the middle. This makes for an efficient plan as all the rooms are around the edge making use of the natural light and the central space is lit from above, so all areas have light throughout the building. Also having a staircase in the centre makes for excellent circulation as all the rooms can be connected without the use of corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘noughts and crosses’ plan has a long history going back to Palladio’s Villa Rotunda and the slightly later Villa Rocca Pisana by Scamozzi. Two centuries later this basic building type became a staple of Georgian architecture, being the inspiration behind houses like Chiswick House and Mereworth Castle. It was the Georgians who came up with the next innovation of putting a staircase in the central hall, which was done by a number of architects, most famously by James Paine at New Wardour Castle in Wiltshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/05.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the Townley estate, the first thing you see is a Greek Revival gate house which sits on the roadside and sets the tone for the house beyond. After driving through the gates, you come into an area of dense woodland which gives way to a beautiful park where the house sits on the high point of the estate. This arrival sequence was not doubt carefully stage managed by a landscape designer of the Capacity Brown school. The house itself is a simple grey stone block almost modernist in its lack of ornament and architectural detailing. Large evenly spaced sash windows punctuate the facades with no surrounds, rustication or pediments. The only piece of ornament is a Greek Revival porch; I say Greek revival, but the Doric columns are far thinner than anything in Ancient Greece and the entablature is straight out of Vignola which makes it Italian Renaissance. But it is none the worse for its eclectic sources. This muted exterior gives nothing away about the excitement of the rotunda within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/09.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this staircase hall that makes Townley a masterpiece and one of the greatest examples of Neoclassical architecture to be seen. This type of stairs, known as a cantilevered stair, has a long history going back millennia. Significantly Palladio wrote about them in Book One of his Four Books of Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the ‘nought and crosses’ plans, English Palladians took their master’s staircase form and reused it with aplomb as can be seen at the Queen’s House, Greenwich and the Dean’s Staircase at St Paul’s. Excellent as these examples by Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren undoubtably are, neither compare with the sheer beauty of Johnston’s staircase at Townley. The whole sequence of seeing the staircase from the entrance hall, framed by the curve of the first floor landing above which reads as an arch, then moving into the round hall and seeing the coffered dome with its massive oculus which gradually reveals itself as you move forward. The scale of the top light apart from bringing in a huge amount of light also means that you can see clouds wafting past and this effects the amount of light in the room moment by moment and so you feel as if you are almost outside. The staircase itself is the thinnest cantilevered staircase imaginable and with its gentle pitch and the smooth underside it gracefully glides up to the light filled pantheon above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this space the walls and dome are ornamented with elegant plasterwork, which is all modelled in shallow relief, and so despite there being a lot of decoration in this space, it does not seem overpowering. The floor also has the most subtle decoration consisting of a complex pattern which is pieced together from the same coloured stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms that surround the rotunda continue the serene simplicity of the elevations and have varying lengths, but all are 24ft in width. There is some ornament on the ceilings and fireplaces, but this like elsewhere in the house is incredibly light and delicate. When I saw the house, these rooms were painted in a variety of colours, some quite bright and filled with the paraphernalia of its educational function. I would love to see what these rooms would look like painted in carefully chosen shades of off white and sparsely populated with Georgian furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley is the end of a long tradition of classical architecture stretching back in an unbroken line to the Renaissance. During the late 18th century this lineage was starting to fragment as gothic, chinoiserie and a myriad of other styles became fashionable. Eventually gothic dominated and Francis Johnson responded by becoming a master of this style too. It would be interesting to speculate how differently the modernist movement would have evolved if it were not for a hostile reaction to the sketchbook froofiness of the Victorians, and instead took off from where Townley landed. Perhaps the architecture of the 20th century would have more taste, charm and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Ancient Love of Quality</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality is so important. It is the different between mass produced bleached white sliced bread assembled in a factory and bread lovingly made in small batches by a baker who really cares. The ingredients are much the same, but the differences are enormous. Whether it is the pleasure of sinking your teeth into a perfect slice of bread or the sensation of turning a well-made door handle, we humans love quality in all its many forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I was in a discussion with some architects whose taste was the polar opposite to mine. It was only when we began discussing the amazing quality of Victorian terraces that we found some common ground. I have come to believe that quality is the only thing that unites all architects from traditionalists like me to modernists like Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. But why is quality so important? Surely if something does its job then that is enough! But we humans are not like that, we want things to be better than they need to be and we can see a beauty in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the quality of the finished buildings which is the reason I take so much pleasure in designing country houses. My clients also share this passion, and we go to great lengths to satisfy this desire. For example, we recently completed an orangery in Norfolk designed in brick which demanded immense care and attention to detail and deliver the pristine finish required. We were using a strong coloured red brick with a white mortar which would really show up any slight mistakes and poor workmanship. This was extremely hard to do but everyone felt that the effort was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are curious in their love of quality and it has very ancient roots. This can be seen from the evidence left by prehistoric tools, most notably the often beautifully made Acheulian hand axes which were produced by our early ancestors from 1,760,000 to 130,000 years ago. These exquisitely crafted objects have been found in their thousands in Asia, Europe and Africa. What is surprising about them is that some were too large to use and others have no evidence of being used. It is thought that due to their symmetry and meticulous workmanship, which was far greater than required for their function, they must have been primarily objects of beauty to be marvelled at for their aesthetic qualities and virtuoso craftsmanship. I find it extraordinary to contemplate that before our ancestors had evolved into humans, they found beauty in the applied arts. Since this was over a million years before we could speak and as thought is so tied up with language, this early form of art appreciation predates our uniquely human way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, when someone made a beautiful hand axe in prehistoric times or today lays a well-crafted brick wall, though separated by hundreds of thousands of years, these objects both display evidence of the care, intelligence, and judgement of their makers which, in evolutionary terms, are desirable personal qualities and so we respond positively. When we see architecture done well, we react to this quality with an involuntary reaction that goes right back to our distant ancestral past. This is not solely a cultural response but an inherent impulse, similar to our deep, ancient and intense love of well baked bread.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Proportions in Architecture and Music</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architects for millennia have sought to find rules to determine the proportions of every aspect of a building. A window, for example, can look too narrow and thin or conversely it can look squat and fat. How can we work out the right proportions? Is there a ratio of height to width which is perfect? Many architects throughout time have felt there are mathematical formulae to achieve the right proportions. This was a particular interest of Renaissance theorists including the Florentine architect Alberti (1404-72) who saw an equivalence between musical and architectural proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am every day more and more convinced of the truth of Pythagoras’s saying, that nature is sure to act consistently and with constant analogy in all her operations: from whence I conclude, that the same numbers, by means of which the agreement of sound affects our ears with delight, are the very same which please our eyes and our minds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;The Ten Books of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; by Alberti book IX Chapter V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic maths behind musical harmony has a clarity and simplicity which appealed to the Renaissance mind. If you take two violin strings under the same tension, with one half the length of the other, and then pluck them both, the difference in pitch is an octave which sounds beautiful. In mathematical terms what you are really enjoying is the ratio of 1:2. If the strings are in a relationship of two to three you have a ‘fifth’ and if they are in a relationship of three to four it will be a ‘fourth’, all beautiful sounds as a consequence of being specific and exact mathematical ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just with strings that these ratios can be observed. The same patterns can be seen in different sized bells, different lengths of metal pipe in brass bands or church organ and the different sizes of wood blocks for a xylophone.  The maths throughout these various ways of making different pitches of sound is the same and so they work with each other. If, for example, a trumpet player was to blow down a long brass tube he or she could make the notes of an arpeggio. This wind instrument’s arpeggio would fit exactly into the previously mentioned octave of the stringed instrument, if they are tuned to the same pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/02a.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/02a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Alberti states, these ideas ultimately go back to the great philosopher and mathematician Pythagorus in the 6th century BC.  He became aware of this when he walked past a blacksmith’s forge and heard the different pitches of the banging on anvils with different sized hammers. When some hammers banged at the same time, they sounded harmonious and others not. He then worked out that the hammers which achieved a pleasant sound were the ones which had a harmonic relationship between each other. For example, if one hammer was exactly twice as heavy as the other, that would produce an octave. He then went on to discover the basic maths of the musical instruments of his day. Through this he came to believe that the same simple number ratios and proportions embodied absolute truth about the harmonic structure of literally everything on earth. But Pythagoras did not stop there, he also was convinced that the same numbers and ratios were consistent throughout the whole universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If earthly objects such as strings or pieces of metal make sounds when put in motion, so too must the moon, the planets, the sun and even the highest stars. As these heavenly objects are forever in motion, orbiting the Earth, surely they must be forever producing sound.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea, known as the ‘Music of the Spheres’, is the belief that the planets and moon spin on their obits, emitting a hum, which is inaudible to us but if we could hear it, it would be some sort of celestial music expressing the perfect harmony of the universe. The planets which are further away were thought to make a lower hum than the ones closer to earth, it was as if the universe was one massive lute or harp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wonderful it would be to believe that certain proportions embody timeless irrefutable truths which are consistent throughout nature, music and architecture. It is so satisfyingly neat… but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we still look for magical formulae to explain the complexities of the universe and this is as true for Pythagorus as it is for Einstein.  In music the octave, the fourth and the fifth still sound beautiful and are used by musicians both ancient and modern. But for architecture, does the analogy work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not think that musical and architectural proportions work the same way. For architectural proportions to be ‘harmonic’ they do not have to be exact. For example, if the double cube room at Wilton was not quite a double cube, is would not be any better or worse, it aims to be a cube and near enough is fine. Architectural proportion is like Goldilocks’s porridge, slightly too hot or cold is fine it is a matter of degree, the closer the better. Music is not like this, slightly wrong is the most discordant sound possible. If an octave is slightly off it sounds completely wrong, even the most tone-deaf person can hear when a violin is even slightly out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/05.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure Palladio would have enjoyed someone post rationalising one for his buildings in terms of musical ratios, but I do not think he would have been at all familiar with these ideas and he certainly did not use them in practice. I can find no written reference to this Pythagorean musical analogy in his Quattro Libri. There may be some number ratios within his designs which appear to have a reference to these ideas but as D. Howard and M. Longair state in their essay ‘Harmonic Proportions and Palladio’s Quattro Libri’ ‘…this is more likely to be down to the practical advantages of using simple easily divisible numbers’. Which makes perfect sense particularly at a time when buildings were set out by lengths of rope and crudely pegged out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/07a.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/07a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly chimes with my understanding of Palladio’s architectural details. With his orders in the Quattro Libri, there is no attempt to use simple numbers let alone clean musical ratios. For example, the height of his Corinthian order is nine and a half times the length of the bottom diameter (rather that an even ten) and the entablature height is one diameter plus nine tenths (rather than an even two). The smaller scale details of the Corinthian order are just the same, virtually every dimension has a fraction attached and this is true for all his orders. Palladio’s drive was to represent a particular form or shape based on his knowledge of the ruins from Ancient Rome and his instinct for proportion. He therefore used whatever numbers and fractions worked to give him the exact dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one set of proportions which I believe are inherently beautiful, these are the classical orders from Ancient Rome. Quite why these proportions are so beautiful is hard to fathom but what is clear is they have nothing to do with musical ratios. In John Summerson’s excellent essay ‘Antitheses of the Quattrocento’ he sums it up in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you are unwilling to accept the five orders as a gift of a myth, delightful and glorious fundamentally because they derive from an old, forgotten world, then you must argue yourself into believing that, somehow or other, they embody absolute values of proportion and ornament; and that argument is difficult in the extreme.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If proportion cannot be attached to some absolute values all we are left with is personal judgement. There is a story about Michelangelo being criticised for making the cornice on Palazzo Farnese too large according to classical rules. To which he replied, ‘My eye is my measure’. Michelangelo, perhaps justifiable felt that his innate sense of proportion was enough with no recourse to anything else. He was effectively saying ‘I know what I like’, which does not sound like a valid architectural theory but perhaps that is all there is, and we should be honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the office we spend hours analysing our designs and trying different proportions of windows and doors in slightly different places to ensure that we have designed the best possible building within the given constraints. It is worth taking time to get these things right because a well-proportioned building costs the same as a badly proportioned one yet is worth so much more. We do this primarily by intuition. This process is not academic or theoretical, but if some latter-day Alberti comes along and finds musical ratios in my work which ties into some greater cosmic order, I certainly will not complain but it does not make it true.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, before we were married, Miranda and I went on holiday to Italy and while traveling between cities on trains I started to write a novel in the back of my sketch book. The story was a mash up between the ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Day of the Jackal’ set in Italy and New England. After a day of writing I proudly read it to Miranda. She patiently listened to the whole thing and when had I finished, I asked her excitedly what she thought of it. She said, I quote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘That’s the biggest pile of crap I have ever heard!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Well that’s honest… I suppose… not the reaction I wanted but fair enough.’ I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not particularly literate and I don’t often read novels so my attempt to write one was like a child on an ice rink for the first time seeing someone doing a pirouette and thinking ‘how hard can it be’. I put it away and never really thought about it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to a decade later, Miranda and I are now married with three small children and I’m trying to amuse them by drawing cartoons. I could not think of a subject for a comic strip and then I remembered that story I had written all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the sketchbook and started to draw it out as a comic. Once I started writing I could not stop, I found it extremely addictive. The result is below and is called ‘Looking for Spinoza’ although it’s has nothing to do with the famous philosophically inclined lens grinder from Holland. The plot instead follows my alter ego crossed with Tintin who falls into Italy’s dark criminal underbelly after finding his uncle murdered in a suburb of Milan. As the story unfolds, he encounters a tattooed sword swallower, an incompetent assassin, a corrupt chief of police and an exploding shark all in his search for the illusive crime fighting mastermind…Ben Spinoza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its initial frosty reception, Ruth Gilding of ‘Bible of British Taste’ fame was very taken with it and she passed it on to her husband, the great A.N.Wilson who described it as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Suspenseful and with a nail-biting plot reversal on almost every page, Looking for Spinoza is both an exciting graphic novel in its own right and an amusing parody of the fast moving thriller.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generous praise indeed! He felt it deserved to be published and he put me in touch Dan Franklin, the publishing director of Jonathan Cape. Had I known that he worked with some of the biggest names in contemporary fiction including Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Martin Amis, I might have taken it more seriously. I met him at his office in Pimlico and he seemed interested and I remember him saying dryly ‘I think it’s very funny’ without cracking a smile. Much as he liked it, he felt it needed better structure, a proper beginning middle and end. I tried briefly to do as he said but I realised it would mean rewriting the whole thing and so I just left it, perhaps to be resumed when I have more time on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘What has this got to do with architecture?’ you might say. Not much, but it’s nearly Christmas I thought I’d post something lighthearted and I am sure we all need cheering up as it’s been a tough year for everyone. Also, if you look carefully you will see works by Bramante, Palladio and Raymond Erith, as well as views of Udine, Milan, Venice and Verona which all go to provide a classical setting for a highly unclassical story.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently my knowledge of Manchester architecture was limited to the inside gatefold of ‘The Queen is Dead’ LP. This shows the Smith’s standing outside the Salford Lads Club, where a terracotta Scamozzi Ionic capital can be seen cheekily peaking our over Morissey’s shoulder. I imagined the rest of the city continued in this vein, which indeed it does but with a scale, grandeur and flamboyance I could have only dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to visit Manchester recently and if you have a taste for Edwardian Baroque architecture, this is the place to go. I am using the term ‘Edwardian’ to be not just the architecture between 1901 and 1910 but the exuberant and confident spirit which pervaded all the arts from the late Victorian period until the First World War. In music it is Elgar, in painting it is John Singer Sargent and in architecture it is a myriad of unknown practitioners whose creativity and skill would make the Baroque masters of Europe quake in their bucket top boots.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great architects of this period was Sir Alfred Waterhouse (1830- 1905) the architect of the Natural History Museum. He initially set up his practice in Manchester and put his stamp on the city with the Town Hall which was his first major commission. This he designed in Gothic style but as time went on, like his contemporary the painter Edward Millais he became more classical. His Refuge Assurance Building designed in partnership with his son Paul combines various styles from Baroque to Dutch Renaissance to make a building which feels surprisingly unified. It reminded me of Schinkel’s now demolished Bauakademie in Berlin, which similarly combines the warm reds and oranges of brick and terracotta. This colour palette is one of the distinctive features of Manchester architecture and can be seen on relatively modest buildings like the Salford Lads Club as well as the grandest buildings in the city. What gives this building an extra level of vibrancy is the use of green for the copper dome which is echoed in the window joinery and downpipes, particularly the downpipes which are one of the hallmarks of the superb attention to detail that can be seen in all of Waterhouse’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of visiting an unfamiliar city is that you inevitably come across brilliant architects you have never heard of. One such individual is the home-grown Mancunian Charles Heathcote (1851-1938) who designed prolifically in a Baroque style. His former Lloyds Bank at 53 King Street in white stone is an essay in shadow casting making the building like an inhabited sculpture. The free-standing ionic columns sit above a lower order of rustication which alternates between smooth and roughly hewn stone. This turns into smooth quoins which continue right up to the chimneys. The corner is beautifully resolved with a mini aedicule with sculpture above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also by Heathcote is the former National Westminster Bank in Spring Gardens, built from red sandstone. This, like his Lloyds Bank, makes a virtue of the corner but with a bold arched entrance door framed by octagonal piers and topped with a dome supported by paired ionic columns as buttresses on each corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just down the road from this is the Former Midland Bank by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Serine and white it sits proudly on King Street like the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus or a formalised pyramid with its form breaking down and reducing as it ascends. Being both Classical and Art Deco it takes the form of many New York skyscrapers of the time with an ornate ground and top floor with simple windows on the intervening floors. The windows are set far back from the stone face of the wall which gives the building a massive and solid character. This contrasts with the thinness of the Doric pilasters on the ground floor which disappear into the rustication halfway up the shaft. For those who enjoy Sir Ned’s usual architectural tricks there is more than enough to keep you happy.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how to do a tower look no further than Lancaster House on Whitworth Street, a former packing and shipping warehouse. Constructed in red brick and orange terracotta designed by Harry S. Fairhurst.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this area there are a plethora of massive Baroque warehouses many of which were designed by Fairhurst. The detail, scale and ornamentation of these buildings is staggering. It makes me feel slightly frustrated that the current solution to warehousing is massive sheds which the owners are so ashamed of that they try to tone them in with the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further out of town is the Royal Infirmary on Oxford Road. Designed by Edwin Hall and John Brooke which was significantly opened by King Edward VII - a statue of the jovial king can be seen close by. I had not heard of either architect, although after a little research I discovered that Edwin Hall also designed Liberty &amp;amp; Co’s flagship store and I am very familiar with its Mock-Tudor façade just off Regent’s Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also walking in the outskirts of Manchester I came across Platt Hall, a Georgian country house by Carr of York which sits with its park almost oblivious to the urban sprawl that surrounds it. It is hard to image this estate within fields only a short carriage ride from Manchester. Although this house is by one of the giants of Georgian architecture, it seemed small fry compared to the confident Edwardian buildings of the city centre. There is an attitude in polite society that it you must like classical architecture make sure it’s the refined well-mannered Georgians. Edwardians are thought to be too vulgar, perhaps ‘criminally vulgar’ as Morrissey would say. But how can you not love their playfully unrestrained buildings? I am beginning to think that maybe these relatively unknown architects are the closest British architects come to the genius of Michelangelo and Borromini.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edwardian spirit held on in Manchester right until the Second World War, decades after King Edward’s death. The extension to the Town Hall and next to it the Pantheon like Central Library were both built in the 1930s and designed by Vincent Harris (1876- 1971). He was great classical architect who design numerous notable buildings including Sheffield City Hall, Leeds Civic Hall, The Ministry of Defence on Whitehall and Kensington Central Library. He was the last of an era yet somehow won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1951 despite substantial opposition from his modernist contemporaries. On accepting the award Harris is reported to have said: “Look, a lot of you here tonight don’t like what I do and I don’t like what a lot of you do …”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/36.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/edwardian-classical-architecture-in-manchester/thumbs/36.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edwardian Classical Architecture in Manchester&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the post war and current architecture is a disaster. It is a pity that Manchester could not continue with the style of Harris, Heathcote, and Fairhurst. It is quite possible to design new Edwardian style buildings, we have the craftsman and the expertise. I designed one of my own a few years ago as a replacement to Knightsbridge Barracks, unfortunately the design never came to fruition, but if an ambitions developer or maybe Mayor Andy Burman reads this and wants to get in touch, I would be happy to oblige. I will even do the first sketch pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Francis Terry and Martin Leay discuss NPPF paragraph 79e</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 79e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 79e’ houses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Weddings and a Lock In</title>
        <description>&lt;!--&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;--&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/01E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/01E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in an intriguing hidden window which lights the alter from the side. This illuminates a carved marble base relief of the ecstatic body of St Francis, suspended in mid air by angels. The light, which seems to come from nowhere, would have seemed like a miracle to the original worshippers who would never have seen an electric light. To give this composition even more potency, the magical light is from the east and so would be seen as Divine. East light has been worshiped for millennia and in a pre-scientific age, when people were instinctively scared of the dark the coming of a new day would be seen as a gift from the gods. This pagan belief is ironically central to Christian theology. The line in Luke’s gospel ‘Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us’ illustrates this belief and this is why most European churches face east. It is not to face Jerusalem as I previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, this side chapel was full of scaffolding which no one seemed to be attending to. This was very useful, because it allowed me to measure high up details which would otherwise be in accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/04E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/04E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/03E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/03E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/05E.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/05E.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rainy Saturday I was happily measuring and I heard some organ music wafting in. Initially I thought it was just someone practicing, but when I peeped out I noticed that the church was packed with a wedding in full swing. I did not want to make a spectacle of myself so hid back in the chapel and carried on measuring. I then heard what I thought was the wedding ending so decided to make my move, but to my dismay it was the opening hymn for another wedding. It must have been peak season, because by the time I could get out tactfully I had witnessed three weddings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, in the same chapel, I was working quite late. A priest was completing some ceremonial hocus pocus over the alter, and when he saw me he rolled his eyes - perhaps thinking he would have to redo the complete ritual. A few minutes later he flicked the lights out and disappeared through a side door, which he angrily slammed behind him. I was now locked in an almost completely dark church with only the statues of Italian nobles and the relics of forgotten saints for company. I stumbled around trying to find a way out, crashing into pews and who knows what. Bearing in mind this was years before mobile phones existed and so I had neither the means to call anyone or the use of a torch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found the front door.  Fortunately it was bolted from the inside, so I undid the bolts and escaped, leaving the church with priceless works of art ready for the taking. I saw a carabiniere across the road and told him that the church was unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I would have tried to communicate using my hotel/restaurant level Italian, but I was so angry I just said &lt;em&gt;“The church over there is wide open, some priest locked me in.”&lt;/em&gt; He looked confused….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think anything was stolen - I never checked.&lt;/p&gt;
