        <title>Orangery in Norfolk</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/124.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/thumbs/124.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new orangery at a house in Norfolk, completed in 2017, was conceived as a sensitive yet striking extension to the existing home. Designed to meet the evolving needs of contemporary family living, the space was intended primarily to house a large open-plan kitchen and informal living area—functions that now form the social heart of the modern home. The goal was not only to increase the footprint of the property but also to enhance the quality of light, flow, and connection to the surrounding garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/005jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/thumbs/005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecturally, the orangery takes its inspiration from the Queen Anne period, a time known for its refined detailing and elegance. This influence is most clearly expressed through the inclusion of tall, generously proportioned windows which allow natural light to flood the interior throughout the day, creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere. The use of red brickwork further ties the new addition to the traditional vernacular of the region, reinforcing a sense of continuity between old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/012.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/thumbs/012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve a high level of craftsmanship and a subtle, timeless aesthetic, special attention was paid to the construction techniques and materials. One notable detail is the use of thinner mortar joints than those typically found in modern brick buildings. This decision was made to replicate the finer, more delicate appearance associated with historic brickwork, helping the new structure to sit harmoniously alongside both the existing house and the wider architectural heritage of the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/035.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/orangery-in-norfolk/thumbs/035.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Orangery in Norfolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful consideration was given to proportions, detailing, and material transitions to ensure that the orangery reads as a distinct architectural element in its own right, while still harmonising with the character and form of the original house. Rather than attempting to replicate the existing structure, the design takes a complementary approach—respecting the historic fabric of the home while clearly expressing its own identity. The result is an elegant, functional, and light-filled space that enhances the daily life of its occupants and pays quiet homage to the architectural traditions that inspired it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>House in Wiltshire</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/01.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the joy of so many English country houses is the layered stories in which they are steeped: the distinctive and attractive form that comes from additions and contractions across centuries, and the underlying sense of how they are shaped by the lives led within them. Since the Regency, architects have designed houses that echo this narrative form, which imply history and reflect the aesthetic of these older houses. Edwin Lutyens was a master of such compositions, designing new houses that on one level feel like sketches of old organic houses, but with all the advantages of better building systems. This new house in Wiltshire, completed in 2018, is a contemporary demonstration of this same theme, resulting in a finely modelled house, a two-story, five-bay classical block with low two-storey wings, mansard roofs and an additional eastern range that faces a walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/02.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house was designed by Francis Terry, one of the leading younger classical architects in practice today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Terry, “the truth is we designed this house from the inside out: thinking about how life would be lived and the rooms that were needed, and then developed the best classical form for the exterior: life came first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terry is well known for his draughtsmanship and for his skill in drawing out sketch elevations and plans by hand as they are discussed with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/03.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the first part of the project to be realised was the summer house – part pool house, part retreat from the main house – which provided the arena for family recreation. It is a simple classical pavilion, with a portico with a shaped gable as a pediment – with reference to the work of Oliver Messel, the gifted theatre designer who turned to architectural projects in the 1960s and ‘70s, especially in Barbados and Mustique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/04.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the summer house there is a generously scaled large family living room, with changing rooms and a place for al fresco meals in front. It is set in a new walled garden, of traditional vernacular built in brick and flint, and planted with borders on which the garden designer Rupert Golby advised. Golby is skilled in the subtle reinterpretation of the romantic classic English garden tradition with simpler planting and a sense of connection with the wider setting. The summer house project provided something of a trial run for the main house, and much pleasure was achieved in the realisation of the union of architecture, garden and landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/05.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/06.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main house is also satisfyingly simple, and despite its plain, crisp ashlar walls, and the formal rhythm of its sash windows and pedimented dormers, it has a sculpted, slightly baroque feel in the way the shadow is cast between the connected blocks of the composition. There is a dignified, alert quality to the property, which owes much to the rigorous proportions of the house, windows and wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house is faced in a light, creamy Bath stone ashlar, under a slate roof, and set against a wooded backdrop: the south front looks out over a lake. It is the result of years of planning and careful design and artisanship (Ketton Stone for the facing ashlar, R.W. Armstrong builders, joinery by S.B. Joinery and plasterwork by Stevensons of Norwich).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/07.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contained quality of the exterior leads to a genuine sense of surprise inside: the house has generously scaled interiors, and tall sash windows flood the rooms with light. The main entrance hall is designed to link with a cross-axial corridor, the passage being indicated by a screen of columns, echoing the arrangements in eighteenth-century houses such as Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland, behind which is an apsidal staircase compartment with a finely detailed oak staircase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/08.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/09.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-proportioned drawing room and billiard room, separated by double doors, fill the south front, and have fine views across the wider landscape. The long dining room, kitchen and breakfast room are situated at the east end, with other supporting spaces, including a generous inner hall and boot room, that essential space of country-house life. The breakfast room is especially attractive, with a Venetian window facing east, to enjoy the morning sun. On the first floor a long, broad axial corridor links the bedrooms, and those in the wings are also more low ceilinged, which gives them a homely feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/10.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/11.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interiors are mellow and bright, with inherited furniture from other family homes, comfortable upholstered chairs and sofas. Interior design advice was also provided by Jane Ormsby Gore, who grew up on the Welsh borders. Her father, Lord Harlech, was ambassador to the US, so she lived for a while in the famous Lutyens-designed embassy there, and has a good understanding of classical interiors; she has worked on numerous country-house interiors, from Ashdown House in Berkshire to Chilham Castle in Kent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the rooms there is an emphasis on comfort, ease of circulation and appropriateness. Colours are in an earthy natural range and pleasantly recessive, such as Naples Yellow, a primrose yellow and a soft moss green in principal rooms, where there are 
full curtains at the windows and good quality upholstered furniture with touches of Indian and Middle Eastern fabrics in the cushions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a new house in the country is a particular challenge, but here it was met with considerable thought, research and design imagination. The house forms a new chapter in the continuing history of English classical country-house design in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/12.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/13.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-wiltshire/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Wiltshire&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of Francis Terry’s first independent projects, and combines imaginatively so many strands of the English country-house tradition with modern taste and technology. It has proved to be a happy home for his clients and their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>House in Suffolk</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/01.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house in Suffolk was an alteration and extension to a modern classical house. The original home was a five bay block with large over hanging eaves, built in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/02.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/03.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Francis Terry was appointed by a new client to extend and improve the property. This presented a rare opportunity to revisit the earlier design, elevate the architecture, and create a more resolved and site-responsive composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house is constructed from buff-coloured brick, a material commonly found in Geor￾gian architecture throughout Suffolk. This material palette was established in the original design and has been continued in the extensions and alterations, helping to ensure visual continuity and local authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/04.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/05.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/06.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The redesign aimed to strengthen the classical language of the original house while intro￾ducing a greater sense of balance and proportion. Previously, a single-storey conservato￾ry on one side and a screen wall on the other disrupted the intended symmetry of the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key interventions by Francis Terry was to address the roof, which in the origi￾nal design featured large overhanging eaves with a shallow pitch that appeared out of proportion with the rest of the house. Francis replaced this with a parapet and a new, 
steeper pitched roof punctuated by dormer windows. This alteration created a more pleasing and balanced composition while significantly improving the attic accommoda￾tion. The new roof retained the use of slate to match the original, maintaining coherence across old and new elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/07.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/08.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/09.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new extensions re-establish a more ordered and harmonious composition. Designed to be symmetrical and subservient in height to the main house, the wings step gently down into the landscape, creating a soft transition between the main block and the surrounding garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situated on rising ground with panoramic views across the surrounding countryside, the site offered the opportunity to make a bolder architectural statement. The extended house now reads as a baroque composition, with arms reaching out toward the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/10.jpg&quot; title=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/house-in-suffolk/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;House in Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the west side of the house is a pool with a pool house also by Francis Terry. This is de￾signed as a picturesque folly in the tradition of garden buildings for country houses. The front façade is a Tuscan order with a small central pediment. Further Tuscan columns frame the pool space on the side of the house, making two sides of an architectural exte￾rior ‘room’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry’s connection to the wider Suffolk region informed the practice’s thoughtful 
approach. Having grown up in the surrounding countryside, he has long held an under￾standing and appreciation of the area’s landscape character and architectural traditions. That knowledge is reflected in every aspect of the redesign. The finished house sits proudly within its landscape, offering a respectful yet distinctive contribution to the archi￾tectural heritage of the region, and serving as a testament to the enduring value of classi￾cal architecture in a contemporary context.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Tapestry Drawing Room at Castle Howard is a completely new architectural treatment to a room which was destroyed by fire in 1940. The room had been left as an empty shell of charred stonework ever since. The brief was to restore the room to what Vanbrugh would have done and incorporate the four Vanderbank tapestries which were designed and woven for the room in 1706.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-04.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-05.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architect Francis Terry worked in collaboration with interior designers Alec Cobbe and Remy Renzullo to realise this vision. The focus of the design is a baroque chimneypiece made from scagliola with an elaborate overmantel, framing a painting of the ‘Judgement of Paris’. A large entablature crowns the room with a decorative rinceau design in the frieze. The two doors have overdoor paintings depicting the life of Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-06.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2025/CHDR-07.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Castle Howard&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/2025/thumbs/CHDR-07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Castle Howard&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Care has been taken to use traditional materials and techniques where possible. All architectural elements of the project were hand drawn by Francis Terry at full size.  Unusually, the room uses onsite run plasterwork made in the traditional way, rather than fibrous plaster made off site which is conventionally used. The frieze of the fireplace has a head of Pluto framed by a cartouche which was carved by hand from limewood. The room is painted a dark blue to bring out the colours of the much-faded tapestries. In keeping with the baroque spirit, the decoration is extensively gilded.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything in the room, apart from the antiques, paintings, and tapestries, was made in the UK within the past eighteen months. The crafts used for this room include: - hand carved timber classical ornament, traditional run plasterwork, scagliola manufacture and gilding. The craftsmanship is truly outstanding, and it is a joy to see that the UK is still world leaders in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five Classical Orders</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proportions and defining features of the five orders of columns are a fundamental part of classical architecture. In this video, Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE delve deep into this cornerstone of the profession. From the rustic undecorated Tuscan order to the detailed and ornate Composite, they reflect on their usage over the years, their rich symbolism as well as the mysterious question of their distant origins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quinlan Terry's Life in Architecture</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr9Z1rpsfek&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is an interview between Francis and his father Quinlan Terry CBE, discussing the many unforgettable moments in his highly successful sixty-year career. His life has seen classical and traditional architecture change from being derided as a joke and even immoral in the ‘50s and ‘60s, to its adoption by Prince Charles and the Post-Modern movement in the ‘80s, and now its total acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as an investigation into these broad cultural trends, Quinlan recounts many of the amusing anecdotes that punctuated his career: these include, working with Profumo during the scandal, collaborating with Sir Anthony Blunt on researching Renaissance architecture, and being in Libya measuring Roman ruins at the time of the Gaddafi coup d’état.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a broad variety of topics discussed, this interview will interest architects and non-architects alike.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission for a New Seven Unit Apartment Scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge Has Been Granted</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/hans-place-12-24.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Planning Permission for a New Seven Unit Apartment Scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge Has Been Granted&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to be part of a team which have been granted planning consent for a new seven unit apartment scheme in Hans Place, Knightsbridge. The new building replaces a modernist style house built in the 1960s, which is unsympathetic to the area both in terms of materials and architectural language. The new design follows the dominant style of the square which consists of highly ornate red brick facades with brown stone and terracotta elements, using a classical style borrowed from diverse sources, including 17th century Dutch and Queen Anne influences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission Granted for a New House in Surrey</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/house-surrey-11-24-2.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Planning Permission Granted for a New House in Surrey&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our design for a new house in Surrey has been given planning permission by Waverley Borough Council. The design reflects local architectural characteristics with the use of stone and red brick, with a clay tile roof. The architectural detailing owes much to the Surrey vernacular and the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens who practiced extensively in the area. The planning submission was coordinated by Janet Long of Planit Consulting and the landscape design was by Nick Tripp of Taylor Tripp.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Planning Permission Granted for a New House in Hampshire</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2024/house-hampshire-11-24.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Planning Permission Granted for a New House in Hampshire&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted that our design for a new house in Hampshire has been given planning permission by South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA). This scheme is particularly exciting as the site was originally laid out by Charles Bridgeman, one of the greatest English landscape designers of the 18th century. The house is designed in the classical style but subtly adapted to fulfil the functional requirements of modern family life. The materials used include brick, stone and flint which reflect local architectural character. The scheme was project managed by Finchatton, the landscape designer was Christian Sweet of Coulson Stone, and the planning consultant was Scot Masker of Masker Architects.&lt;/p&gt;
