        <title>Three Weddings and a Lock In</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in an intriguing hidden window which lights the alter from the side. This illuminates a carved marble base relief of the ecstatic body of St Francis, suspended in mid air by angels. The light, which seems to come from nowhere, would have seemed like a miracle to the original worshippers who would never have seen an electric light. To give this composition even more potency, the magical light is from the east and so would be seen as Divine. East light has been worshiped for millennia and in a pre-scientific age, when people were instinctively scared of the dark the coming of a new day would be seen as a gift from the gods. This pagan belief is ironically central to Christian theology. The line in Luke’s gospel ‘Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us’ illustrates this belief and this is why most European churches face east. It is not to face Jerusalem as I previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, this side chapel was full of scaffolding which no one seemed to be attending to. This was very useful, because it allowed me to measure high up details which would otherwise be in accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/thumbs/04a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/thumbs/03a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/thumbs/05a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One rainy Saturday I was happily measuring and I heard some organ music wafting in. Initially I thought it was just someone practicing, but when I peeped out I noticed that the church was packed with a wedding in full swing. I did not want to make a spectacle of myself so hid back in the chapel and carried on measuring. I then heard what I thought was the wedding ending so decided to make my move, but to my dismay it was the opening hymn for another wedding. It must have been peak season, because by the time I could get out tactfully I had witnessed three weddings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/three-weddings-and-a-lock-in/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Weddings and a Lock In&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another time, in the same chapel, I was working quite late. A priest was completing some ceremonial hocus pocus over the alter, and when he saw me he rolled his eyes - perhaps thinking he would have to redo the complete ritual. A few minutes later he flicked the lights out and disappeared through a side door, which he angrily slammed behind him. I was now locked in an almost completely dark church with only the statues of Italian nobles and the relics of forgotten saints for company. I stumbled around trying to find a way out, crashing into pews and who knows what. Bearing in mind this was years before mobile phones existed and so I had neither the means to call anyone or the use of a torch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found the front door.  Fortunately it was bolted from the inside, so I undid the bolts and escaped, leaving the church with priceless works of art ready for the taking. I saw a carabiniere across the road and told him that the church was unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I would have tried to communicate using my hotel/restaurant level Italian, but I was so angry I just said &lt;em&gt;“The church over there is wide open, some priest locked me in.”&lt;/em&gt; He looked confused….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think anything was stolen - I never checked.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ornament Podcast</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the 20th century the addition of ornament to architecture was considered a crime. After several decades of dull unadorned buildings, architects and clients started to hunger for the decorative elements of bygone eras. This revival came as part of the postmodern movement during the 1980s. Since then the use of ornament has been more accepted but still viewed with suspicion by the modernist establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ornament was my way into architecture. When I started working for my father during school and university holidays it was ornament which was my primary role. I had an interest and a facility for it from an early age and I became know within the office for drawing out full size details of Corinthian capitals, keystones, swags, chimneypieces, decorative ceilings and anything which demanded ornament. My output was known humorously as ‘the pretties department’ - a label I initially found patronising as it seemed that the ‘proper architects’ were doing construction and running contracts and I, like a child, was quietly drawing frivolous and unnecessary decoration. But I grew to love the label as I started to understand the importance of ornament and for that matter, prettiness too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some images which I drew over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I chaired the Traditional Architecture Group’s first round table discussion and we chose ornament as the subject. As panellist’s we had Svante Helmbaek Tirén, a renowned architecture theorist with an interest in ornament and Sandy Stoddart, perhaps the greatest living figurative sculptor. The discussion covers many aspects of ornament in architecture with valuable contributions from Robert Adam, Hugh Petter and George Saumarez Smith. Due to the coronavirus we had to do this as a zoom discussion instead of live, which was a pity, but it did have the advantage that many people from far afield could join us which would not have been possible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fascinating discussion and we covered a whole variety of topics. The questions which we grappled with included:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why was the modern moment so hostile to ornament?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is ornament just about the play of light on a surface?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does ornament need to follow historic precedent?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How does dirt on buildings affect ornament?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made this into a podcast which &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-365839898/interview-ornament&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can listened to by following this link&lt;/a&gt;, you are in for a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Versailles Redesigned</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Coronavirus turned the world upside down Miranda and I took our younger two children to see Versailles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bad saying this, but when I walked up to the front of Versailles I was struck by how unimpressive it was despite all the money spent on it. I do not want to sound negative, but I do feel it was a wasted opportunity. The palace itself seems too small in the context of all the outbuildings that it almost disappears. I later learnt that I am not the first person to make this observation, Jean-Baptiste Colbert a minister of finances during Louis XIV’s reign felt that his boss had turned Versailles into an ‘a little man with big arms and a large head’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden side is not much better. The palace façade monotonously repeats the same bay configuration with little variation for its whole quarter of a mile length. The silhouette is dull and the whole composition is lacking in drama or excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is remarkable that architects as great as Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart should have produced such an underwhelming building. ‘Come on lads, what went wrong?’ I feel compelled to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect the reason is twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Versailles is a series of massive additions to a relatively modest original chateau. The great architect Charles Perrault who was also a senior official in the Royal Building Office claimed that Louis kept the original building for sentimental reasons. Working in this ad hoc way requires great skill to ensure that the final building look right and even the king had his reservations. In letter of 1699, written by Louis XIV’s second wife, Madame de Maintenon, she revealed that her husband privately admitted that Versailles would have been better had he demolished the old chateau entirely before starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And secondly, Louis XVI was a control freak. He was fascinated by architecture and had regular meetings on Thursdays with his architects, an impressive commitment for a busy king. A hands-on client is great, but they do need to respect and listen their architect if they want the best results. This would have been hard for Louis who from birth was bought up to believe that he was quite literally a gift from god or ‘Dieudonné’, a name he evidently took to heart. I image that the great ideas of Le Vau and Manart’s were ignored and they ultimately just resorted to timidly pleasing their client rather that doing great architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I returned home and aided by the extra time which the coronavirus lockdown has generated, I set myself the task of redesigning Versailles.
For the front elevation to get over the problem of the diminutive central block I added a building to separate the Cour Royale from the Cour des Statues. In the middle of this block is a triumphal arch which frames the original chateau in the distance. By adding this building, the small scale of the centre of the palace is masked and give both courts a more pleasing proportion. The separation would also give a more interesting and varied arrive sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/versailles-redesigned/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Versailles Redesigned&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the garden elevation I propose adding a large central block to break the monotony and to make a more interesting silhouette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astute observer will notice that these designs have a certain dept to Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor. It did make me speculate what would have happened had Louis XIV beaten the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim. Perhaps he would have taken the first dukes’ architects and asked them to remodel Versailles. My light-hearted scribblings are a guess at what they might have produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;For this article I am indebted to Tony Spawforth's book *Versailles: A Biography of a Palace* and *Love and Louis XIV: The Women in the Life of the Sun King* by Antonia Fraser. Both excellent books which I can thoroughly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry’s Versailles Redesigned drawings mix ‘bolshy arrogance’ and spectacular images to take practitioner commended place in Eye Line 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to love an entry that is titled ‘Versailles Redesigned’ and this, coupled with traditionalist architect Francis Terry’s great skill in draughting and colour wash, meant that it scored highly with all the judges. Though those seeing it as a top three contender were in a minority, these watercolours were always there in the discussion, as a kind of ground anchor….&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Terry and Associates are pleased that planning permission has been granted for a new country house in Northamptonshire. This is great news and shows that amongst all the confusion of the past few months things are moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house is based on the manor house tradition, using local iron stone with smooth ashlar architectural elements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lockdown is slowly being relaxed, more building sites are looking to return to productivity.  This is obviously problematic – from the restrictions of welfare facilities on sites to many trades trying to work around each other.  Is there a safer, easier to police way of building houses that would enable social distancing to be maintained whilst still being productive and efficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the Covid 19 crisis, housing is still a pressing issue and all the major political parties are keen to show how this problem may be solved. The government has set a target of building 300,000 homes a year by the middle of the next decade. Despite recent increases in activity, the volume of houses built is nowhere near this figure and the problem will only get worse. Policy makers are desperately trying to think of a new way to deliver more houses because the traditional methods of building are not delivering the volume required. Many people think that off-site methods are the only way of solving this problem. The perception is that it would be cheaper and quicker because it would avoid many of the problems of a traditional building site. Minimizing time on site has the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building sites must deal with unpredictable weather, including rain, wind, frost or even snow which slows and sometimes halts production. Working in a factory, the temperature can be controlled and working inside also eliminates the problem of rain, snow and wind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building sites are inherently dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less time on site means less disruption caused by noise, dust and extra local traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With skill shortages being a real problem on building sites, working off-site in a factory would help because the workers would not need to spend time travelling to different places and they could work in comfort. This would help to retain workers in the construction industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality control is easier to monitor in a factory rather than on a building site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these factors work together to make the houses cheaper and quicker to build. nHouse claims it can build a house in 20 days in the factory which can then be erected on site in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not in a hypothetical realm here, building houses in factories is already done in vast quantities. Predictably Japan and Germany are leading the way, but the U.K. has already started to embrace this new trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Booth writing in the Guardian (31/12/17) observed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One of Britain’s major housebuilders is to prefabricate up to a quarter of its homes in a factory, in the latest attempt by the construction industry to tackle the housing shortage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berkeley Homes, which builds 4,000 homes a year, is planning to create a facility in Kent next year where builders will work to produce up to 1,000 houses and apartments annually which will then be craned on to sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another company, nHouse, is setting up a factory in Peterborough with the capacity to build 400 homes a year, complete with light fittings, bathrooms, bookshelves and kitchens. Production is expected to start in January.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other developers, including Legal and General and Urban Splash, have launched prefab home divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionalists (like me) should not fear this development because prefabrication has been with us since classical times. There is substantial evidence that the Romans had standard column sizes which were used extensively throughout the empire. But a more critical question to ask is, can these prefabricated houses be beautiful? Beautiful boats, cars, bicycles, furniture, clothes, shoes, or whatever you care to mention, can be made in factories, and so why not houses? It can certainly be done in timber, the Americans have been building attractive prefabricated timber houses for years. To do this using heavy materials like brick is more complex but I believe quite possible. I have seen vast brick and stone wall panels for office buildings being made offsite and so I cannot see why this could not be done for housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build in volume, houses must be popular and tap into what most people find beautiful. The modernist style can be very beautiful, but it is not for everyone. Modern style buildings generally fall into the ‘marmite’ category, you either love them or you hate them. A popular house needs to be more general in its appeal. For this I would suggest that designing in the traditional style rather than a modern style is the answer. Every estate agent knows that it is far easier to sell a traditional style house than a modern one, Georgian properties being the most popular. This is backed up by the findings of a MORI poll of 2015 which demonstrates that people prefer traditional style houses to modern by a substantial margin. The traditional style houses for this survey were taken from Poundbury and are new build classical Georgian style properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity of the Georgian style should come as no surprise. The Georgians took beauty seriously dedicating whole architectural treatises to the study of proportion and the recording of beautiful mouldings from ancient Greece and Rome. Modernism, by contrast came from a functionalist origin with the belief that beauty would result as a consequence of building well and fulfilling the brief. But as Robert Venturi and others have observed, the Vitruvian triad of commodity, firmness, and delight, (or in layman’s terms; function, structure and beauty) is not an equation. Function plus structure does not always equal beauty, each of the three needs to be considered separately and with equal seriousness. The simple Georgian terrace or house has embodied proportional theories which go back to Palladio and ultimately ancient Greece and Rome. This is why they are generally perceived to be beautiful and the reason why they are so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Georgian style and specifically classicism is particularly applicable to the current housing crisis because it was built in such a huge volume and at an incredible speed. Classicism was maintained throughout the Victorian era and up until the First World War. The developers of the 18th and 19th century wanted to build quickly and cheaply and so it is useful to see how they produced beautiful buildings within the same parameters. A striking feature of these buildings is the repetition of all architectural elements. This is as much true for Downing Street as a modest Georgian terrace anywhere in the country. The use of repeated elements makes the building process more efficient because it eliminates one-off items which are time consuming and costly to produce. There is a worry that even if beautiful Georgian style buildings could be made in a factory this would not be desirable as they would all be the same and none of the houses would have any individuality. I do not see this as a problem. I have recently designed a housing range for Halsbury Homes and we deliberately made all the houses look similar and I feel that the repetition gives the buildings better group value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/beautiful-homes/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Can Beautiful Homes Be Built in a Factory?&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where many new housing developments do wrong, at great expense developers make all the houses look different and the result is a very ‘noisy’ visual experience. The use of repetition has a calming effect on the eye because it does not need to process so much information. Georgian buildings are full of standard products made off-site, these include sash windows, doors, staircases, fireplaces, ceiling rosettes, cornicing and skirtings.  This means that reproducing Georgian architecture is well suited to off-site factory production and the Georgian builder would have happily prefabricated whole houses if it was possible at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Classical style which the Georgian and Victorian architects employed so well has been adapted to so many different materials and building methods. I feel sure that if house builders required classical style buildings to be made off-site in sufficient volume this could easily be done. The reason why so much off-site buildings are so hideous is because of the taste of the designers and that is where the problem lies. Many architects like to make their buildings look original and fear being ‘pastiche’. The definition of pastiche is ‘an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work, artist, or period’. For some reason architects always try to avoid being labelled in this way, but I feel that as with all art forms, the artist (or architect in this case) is part of a tradition stretching back thousands of years that evolves and develops over time. Generations of architects have tried to make beautiful buildings and it is worth benefiting from their knowledge. To avoid being pastiche is, in my opinion, the biggest stumbling block to the production of beautiful houses. It is a far greater obstacle than the engineering problem of producing beautiful houses off-site. If we can get to the moon and split the atom, the technical issues of making beautiful homes in a factory is well within our capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Amor Fati - A Classical Attitude to Covid-19</title>

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realise this, and you will find strength’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Emperor Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this pandemic, with people dying by the thousands and the feared possibility of a global recession of elephantine proportions, I could be criticised for nonchalantly blogging about the finer points of classical architecture. So, I felt it is time to write something relevant to this crisis and from the heart. I have decided to write about how I get through hard times, at least in theory, which you might find useful. I am slightly nervous about posting this, in fact I wrote the first version a while ago, posted it for a couple of days and then took it down. It did not seem the right time, but now certainly is. You can rest assured this is a one off, next month I will go back to discussing triglyphs and metopes in the normal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at stressful times like now when many people take comfort in religion, which is fine, but religion has never really worked for me. I was bought up as an evangelical Christian with the belief that if you were not a Christian in a limited and very specific way, you would literally burn in the fires of hell for all eternity after you died. Unsurprisingly I could not reconcile that with a loving god and far from giving me comfort it made me scared and unhappy. Over time I freed myself from these unpleasant thoughts and have now adopted Stoicism which for many reasons suits me well. It is a very positive philosophy and like many things that appeal to me, it is classical in origin and was even espoused by the great roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. He was himself a man who incidentally lived through Antonine Plague of 165 to 180 AD, an ancient pandemic that wiped out a third of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoicism is also deeply ingrained into the British psyche, it’s the blitz mentality, it’s Nelson giving orders while dying at Trafalgar and now it is the nurses, like my sister Sophie, who risk their lives while cheerfully caring for the sick. This ‘stiff upper lip’ and ‘no nonsense’ way of getting through life appeals to my repressed public school nature particularly at a time when people seem to get offended by anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I take from Stoicism is the desire to love the hand fate has dealt you, whatever it is. I therefore try not to dwell on things I can not change but instead embrace all the things I can effect with enthusiasm, energy and resourcefulness. ‘Great in theory’ you may say and I’d agree, it does not always work, but it’s an aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same attitude was shared by the great stoic Epictetus who said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Don’t seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/amor-fati/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amor Fati - A Classical Attitude to Covid-19&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of self help books and religions focus on happiness; I feel this is a mistake. Happiness needs to be earned and it is never a permanent state. Who, apart from someone either very stupid or those oblivious to the suffering in the world around them could be happy the whole time? In evolutionary terms the complacency of happiness is dangerous, anxiety is far more useful. A while ago I was at a wedding and I heard a sermon that really stuck in my mind. The preacher made an argument which rested on the assumption that animals are happy in their natural state. ‘Has this man ever watched David Attenborough?’ I thought to myself. I am no zoologist, but from my limited knowledge, life for animals in the wild is anything but happy. Think of the zebra on an African plane, they are constantly looking around fearful of a lion appearing from nowhere and ripping them apart, limb from limb, while still alive. This would be an extremely painful death, which brings to mind the worst of medieval torture. This way of dying is a common occurrence for a zebra, and it is probably happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zebra who wakes up in the morning and thinks…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…..life is wonderful, how lucky we are to live in such a beautiful part of the world, blue sky…..again! Why are you lot looking around all the time, the lions won’t bother us today, don’t be so pessimistic. Relax enjoy yourself….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zebra do not think like this for the simple reason that all those zebras are dead. They are what is known in lion circles as ‘low lying fruit’. This is why all zebras who live to any age are constantly worried about their imminent death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not feel any less sorry for the lions, they have to catch these zebras who are impossibly quick and if the lion does not catch any for a while he or she will be too weak to chase them and so die of starvation. What does the zebra and the lion get out of life? Is their life worth living or are we doing them all a favour by bringing them all to the brink of extinction? ….I would argue not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche asking a similar question with this theory of eternal returns. The question he posed was, would you, with all the suffering of your own life, live it all over again exactly the same. The answer must be a resounding loud YES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the struggle, not happiness, which gives life its vivid and colourful intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘It’s easy for you to say that’&lt;/em&gt; you may feel, and that’s true. I come from a privileged background and so I really know nothing of suffering to any great extent. But don’t take it from me, take it from Seneca who suffered more than most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent—no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, Stoics will not waste time wishing Covid-19 did not exist or worrying about the consequential recession. Instead they would focus on what they can change, which is to protect themselves and their families, help the vulnerable and use this down time productively. These hard times are an opportunity to reflect and build resistance so hopefully coming out the other side an emotionally stronger and better person who makes the most of this amazingly beautiful, joyous yet terrifying world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any crafter will know, starting a project is one thing – finishing it is something totally different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Francis Terry and his family the lockdown has meant a project which was started in February has become a real focus for quality time together, and as well as being admired by many of Francis’s followers via social media, it was picked up by Architectural Digest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/this-english-family-is-painting-its-way-through-the-pandemic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who ran this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope it inspires you to start (and complete) something creative if you find yourself with more time during this lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Francis Terry Podcast</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2020/04/01.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us have experienced boredom to some extent or other during this lockdown. You may have noticed that Francis Terry has been overcoming this by trying different drawing styles (see the April blog – &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/how-to-draw-like-raphael/&quot; alt=&quot;How to Draw Like Raphael&quot;&gt;How to Draw Like Raphael&lt;/a&gt;).  Another new string to his bow has been uploading his first podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Francis is interviewed by his son, and the nuggets of wisdom they discuss include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who was the best classical architect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s important about classical architecture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Gothic architecture so appealing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis hopes to create more podcasts to entertain himself – and hopefully you – over the coming months. Please feel free to use the social media links at the bottom of the website to message us with suggestions for future talks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Draw like Raphael</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/how-to-draw-like-raphael/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/images/essays/how-to-draw-like-raphael/thumbs/01F.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to Draw like Raphael&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today exactly five hundred years ago Raphael, the great renaissance artist, died. His body was laid to rest in the Pantheon, perhaps the most sacred and important place in Rome. His mistress, Margarita Luti , was barred from attending the funeral and Maria Bibbiena, his fiancé of convenience was later buried beside him. The day of his death was allegedly his birthday and also Good Friday. The symmetry of Raphael dying on the day of his birth would not be lost on the minds of renaissance intellectuals with their love of clean, pure numbers, harmonic ratios and proportions. Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ died would also have significance and was one of the many parallels drawn between the two. Like Jesus, despite his early death and relatively short career, Raphael’s influence over all subsequent generations is hard to underestimate. Rembrandt, Renoir and Picasso all borrowed directly from him, not to mention the whole tradition of western academic painting. Even the PreRaphaelites who formed in opposition to his work, could not help using is name to define themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raphael also represents a fault line, a B.C./A.D. moment in the chapters of art history books. He, along with Michelangelo and Leonard da Vinci, became the heroes of the high renaissance which was perhaps the greatest moment of creativity the western world will ever see. The youthful and charming Raphael found himself at the center of this vortex and his death heralded the end of a golden age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest praise one can give an artist is to say he or she draws like Raphael. It comes in the same package as writing like Shakespeare or ‘bending it like Beckham’. As I can’t write poetry and don’t play football the latter two challenges are not open to me, but drawing like Raphael… how hard can it be? Picasso arrogantly said he drew like Raphael from childhood. But how good were Raphael’s drawings? Perhaps Picasso picked an easy target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video below shows my attempt and I admit it was harder than the spontaneous lines of Raphael suggest. During this time stuck at home you may like to have a go yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy drawing and stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;
