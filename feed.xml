        <title>Buckingham Palace Redesigned</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/buckingham-palace-redesigned/01.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	In celebration of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, Country Life ran a lighthearted competition to improve the front elevation of Buckingham Palace. Most architects hate this façade as it is seen to represent everything that is wrong with classical architecture. Imperious, pompous and grandiose are some of the adjectives used to describe this building.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I am unusual within my profession because I actually really like it and so I do not feel it needs changing. But if I could make alterations and in the festive spirit of the challenge, this is what I would do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;It has a dull silhouette which needs enlivening with domes and sculpture.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The central portico would benefit from being widened, a four columned portico on such a wide elevation seems like a wasted opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The small windows at capital level, I would replace with stone swags.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The courtyard could do with a few trees framing the entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Apart from these small tweaks, the rest should stay as it is.
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TAG Talk: A Life In Sketchbooks</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBDhmRNmHFU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis gave a zoom talk on his sketching through the decades to the Traditional Architects Group recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketchbooks have always been a critical part of an architect’s work. Francis Terry has a collection of sketchbooks going back forty years to his childhood holidays in Italy sketching architecture with his father, Quinlan Terry. Over the decades he has used sketchbooks as a source of inspiration for his architecture and other artistic ventures ranging from paintings to book illustrations and stage set designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Francis discusses his work from his various sketchbooks and focus on how these drawings inspired his work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NPPF Paragraph 80e Explained</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u1XGLJ6ouJI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 80e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 80e’ houses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I needed to get a puncture on my daughter’s bike repaired, I have long since given up trying to repair them myself, and so I went to the Bike Doctor in East Bergholt just down the road. He obligingly took my bike and said I’ll have this done in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes! When I get a puncture it usually takes me about ten years to summon up the necessary enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what could I do in East Bergholt for ten minutes? I thought I would go and visit the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve lived in the area for most of my life I know East Bergholt church but not well. I have been to one or two weddings there but otherwise I have hardly ever been. Though fairly typical of the churches of the area, it is a rather amazing in its own way. It looks like the tower fell down but in fact it was never completed. Popular legend suggests that this was due to local celeb, Cardinal Wolsey’s fall from grace in 1530 ending funds to the church, but a far more likely reason was Henry VIII’s breach with Rome. With Protestant ideas gaining ground, the desire for ostentatious church buildings disappeared overnight and so work simply stopped. I have noticed in Dedham Church, when ascending the tower to wind the clock, the beginnings of elaborate fan vaulting which similarly was put on hold. It makes me wonder about the conversations between the client and master mason, who presumably had bought all the stone at a great price. How did they break the news, and did they know how final this was? I can hear the project manager saying, ‘It’s just a temporary blip, just wait until this Anne Boleyn thing has sorted itself out’, Little did they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something wonderful about seeing a building where the evidence of the makers hand stretching back hundreds of years is so evident. This is particularly easy to read because of the half-finished state of the church tower. I enjoy the wobbliness - the slight inconsistencies - caused by a medieval mason trying to get something done as best they can with the primitive tools of the time. These human touches are underpinned by the most exceptional craftsmanship, particularly the flint work. I know people who can do this type of work but it’s highly skilled, extremely expensive and time consuming. Over the years the materials have been eroded giving the walls an organic quality as if you’re looking at a cliff face or the trunk of an ancient tree. Weeds find places to grow, and moss colonises the walls in damp places under label mouldings or between dentils. Over time, the ravages of the seasons cause the walls to decay making once impenetrable stone and brick crumble and flake like a mature Cheddar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/12.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior is again very typical of parish churches up and down the land. A medieval structure with the usual layer of Victorian furniture designed to high churchify a white plain structure which the Puritans had denuded. So, we have the usual Victorian pulpit, lectern, screen, the high alter and an organ case which has something of a fairground about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorial wall tombs of all periods pepper the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always intrigued by the most recent layer of history, things just left around:- fire extinguishers, postcards raising money for the church roof and the paraphernalia of the flower rota sit cheek by jowl with ancient fonts and tombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/17.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/18.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was there, a man came in wearing a cycle helmet, he apologised for his attire. I said I didn’t mind. I think he thought I was the vicar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived back at the garage to find that the Bike Doctor had mended the puncture and also oiled the break cables which were a little rusty and loosed the gear changing mechanism which had been jammed by caked mud… all for fifteen quid, what a bargain!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no correct way to pursue a career in architecture. Often, it is perceived that high academic performance and grades are what this profession heavily relies on. In Francis’ most recent podcast, he debunks the myths and offers advice for young people interested in perusing a similar occupation. Francis is joined by his daughter, Claudia, who interviews him one on one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Secret of Popular Architecture</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I have collaborated a number of times with Create Streets, an organization which aims to promote street based and human centred architecture. I had been introduced to the founder of Create Streets, Nicholas Boys Smith, via a mutual friend from Cambridge, and I first met him in Waterstone’s cafe in Piccadilly. He arrived brandishing various pamphlets filled with hard-nosed research backing up ideas of which I agreed. Though I had an instinct that traditional urbanism with its terraced streets and town squares was a better way to build than high rise towers with indeterminate space between, I was unaware that the vast data which backed up this prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worthy as this data undoubtedly is, I felt that it probably did not make a connection with many people apart from a few academically inclined specialists in the field. So I suggested doing a counter proposal for a live site to demonstrate these important ideas and so attract a larger audience, with the aim to influence architecture for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much reflection Nicholas chose the site at Mount Pleasant Sorting Office. This was ideal because it was a large central London site which was being developed in a way which was unsympathetic to the thoughts and requirements of the local residents. They had contacted Nicholas at the time to see if Create Streets could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas and I met the local campaigners, walked the site and then sat down with them to draw a proposal. I always enjoy sitting with people and designing a proposal in front of them, apart from being a fun experience it is also the best way to make the most of the combined wisdom of everyone in the room. Residents will always know far more about the site than an architect who only visits for a short while. Following this design day we then presented options to a broader group of local residents at a small exhibition, we followed their advice and used this to develop a more detailed design.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas and I have worked on a variety of projects in this way. Our aim is to put people, and most particularly local residents, at the heart of planning decisions. All too often other concerns like traffic, zoning and even well intentioned regulations conspire against those that are most affected by a new development. By giving people a voice, our work is much more popular than a scheme which is developed without consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/urbanism/03/01.jpg&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/urbanism/05/tall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing popular architecture is one of our key aims and an aspect of building which has been largely ignored in recent years. Despite the egalitarian pretence of many architects, they all too often wilfully imposed their work on an unwilling audience with disastrous results. Through extensive consultation we aim to design schemes which are genuinely loved and thereby easing the path of new development which is much needed with the current shortage in housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have most enjoyed while working with Create Streets is using my talents to help people in a very direct way. Though our collaborations started as counter proposals with no realistic chance of being built, as time goes by, we are increasingly asked to design schemes which do have a real chance of coming to fruition. I look forward to seeing these proposals being built and I hope that our shared ideas will be seen to have a very positive affect on the architecture of our towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drawing - Death Survival Revival</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you give me some paper and pencils, I’m happy and it has always been this way ever since I was a child. My earliest memories were never having enough paper, I used to draw in the blank pages in books and occasionally on walls. I found the abilities to create a world intoxicating, from lines, marks and smudges on the page people come to life, cities are built, jungles explored, and it can all be rubbed out in an instant and more things can be created in the same place…what godlike power!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was and still is my passion and therefore I am saddened by the wholesale abandonment of drawing from art education in recent times. I’m not arguing against modern art, I just feel that as an accountant should be able to add and subtract, an artist should be able to draw fluently whatever style of art he or she later decides to employ. With Picasso, for example, whatever you think of him, his exceptional drawings which he did as a child give the rest of his work an authority it would not otherwise have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at school we were taught how to draw, admittedly it was not L’École des Beaux-Arts, but we did learn the basics of perspective, composition and casting shadows. The art room as full of drawings of typewriters, sculls, musical instruments and a myriad of objects carefully rendered with painstaking precision. Today this is not the case, GCSE and ‘A’ level art is more orientated around writing about art than actually doing it. This was recently illustrated by an extremely gifted young artist who made national news by failing art GCSE. I have heard that art educators do not focus on drawing because they do not want to discriminate against those who are not talented, an issue which every other subject, particularly the maths and science boards, do not remotely worry about. The result of this well-meaning yet misplaced wokery is the accidental discrimination against talented artists who have no other way to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picasso famously said that when he was a child he drew like Raphael and it had taken his whole life to learn to draw as a child. This attitude came out of the avant garde, who saw everything that tradition valued as culpable for everything that is wrong with the world. Academic drawing fell into this category and so the drawings of an uneducated child, untainted by western civilisation, were seen as preferable to the works of Raphael. It took time for these ideas to sink in, initially it was just the opinion a few eccentric artists but gradually over the years it developed slowly until now, a hundred years later, this ideology is as mainstream and bourgeois as IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, this unfortunate situation is not true of other art forms, everyone understands the value of a classical training in piano or ballet which involves hours of often dull hard work and disciplined study over many years. We all believe Malcolm Gladwell when he states that for the ability to do anything well, you need to practice for 10,000 hours before the age of twenty. Unfortunately drawing is now not a subject where this rule is applied, ‘self-expression’ is the aim. The result is that drawing has descended from an admired pursuit of geniuses like Leonardo and Michelangelo to little more than therapy. I do not want to deny this role of drawing; putting marks on a page to depict a form is therapeutic but splashing around in the shallow end of a swimming pool is all very well, but you’re going to enjoy it more if you learn how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/06.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my life, I have drawn comics, portraits, book illustrations, my children, stage set designs and of course buildings which I draw daily. Drawing has enriched my life in so many ways I worry that future generations of potentially talented artists who have not learnt how to draw are cheated out of something incredibly life affirming, joyful and an activity they were born to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say most art schools being ‘avant garde’ in spirit do not teach drawing. Until the 1960s, art schools had regular life drawing classes and rooms full of plaster casts of the great sculptures of antiquity and the Renaissance for students to draw. This has all gone and the casts have been chucked in a skip and the life models service is no longer required. The result is that people are voting with their feet; a decreasing number of people are taking art A level and an Art School degree is not valued by future employers, particularly me, an employer of creative people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is not all bad, though good drawing is not valued by the art establishment, it is still valued by a vast number of ordinary people judging by the amount of ‘how to draw’ videos on the internet and the enduring popularity of Old Masters both in galleries and exhibitions. A drawing by Raphael is still worth millions and a child’s drawing, charming as it may be, only has value for the parents. As a consequence of this counterculture movement, a few art schools do teach drawing in the tradition way and if you would like to learn how to draw, I suggest you apply to one of them. Here are a few (some also teach painting and sculpture):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.florenceacademyofart.com&quot; alt=&quot;The Florence Academy of Art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Florence Academy of Art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academyofartbarcelona.com&quot; alt=&quot;Barcelona Academy of Art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Academy of Art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://londonfineartstudios.com/&quot; alt=&quot;London Fine Art Studios&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London Fine Art Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandcentralatelier.org&quot; alt=&quot;The Grand Central Atelier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Grand Central Atelier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chelseaclassicalstudio.com/schoolofart&quot; alt=&quot;Chelsea Classical Studio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chelsea Classical Studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can just teach yourself as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Haywain by John Constable</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Haywain by John Constable&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain by John Constable, is perhaps the most famous English painting. Painted exactly two hundred years ago, the scene depicts Flatford in Suffolk which I know well as it is only a few miles from where I live and I often take my little West Highland Terrier out for walks in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/social.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the left of the Haywain is a cottage know as Willy Lott’s House. This was owned by a tenant farmer of that name in Constable’s time. It has not changed much in the intervening years thanks to carefully maintenance by the National Trust. Behind Constable’s viewpoint is Flatford Mill which was owned by the painter’s father and gave him sufficient wealth to contemplate being an artist rather than working on the land. This is a charming collection of buildings despite being built with utility rather than aesthetic in mind. There is very little self-conscious architecture to be seen apart from a Gibbsian entrance door which is shoehorned into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain has been reproduced on countless mugs, tea towels, jigsaws and postcards all over the world. This notoriety has made Willy Lott’s House, despite its small scale, the most famous house in the country, more widely recognised than Chatsworth, Castle Howard or Blenheim. In fact, it may well be the most famous house in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable depicts Willy Lott’s House as a harmonious part of the whole scene, as natural as the trees, the mill pond and the clouds. Willy Lott, according to legend had never been outside his own horizon and the materials that built his house were similar. The timber framed structure was made from trees which grew nearby; the lime for the rendered walls would have been found in local fields and the clay for the bricks and tiles for the foundations, chimneys and roof would have been dug up and fired in a makeshift kiln close to the site. This house therefore was not an outside intervention but simply made up of the materials from the landscape rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Constable painted this picture, it was seen as a surprising subject for such a large scale of painting. At the time, paintings of this size and ambition would depict a biblical or historical narrative designed for the elevation and improvement of the viewer. To paint a simple landscape with a cottage and a cart in a mill pond was not nearly heroic enough. Earlier artists would have replaced Willy Lott’s house with a classical temple in the manner of Poussin or Claude Lorraine and maybe the haywain with Apollo’s chariot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/12.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable was part of a shift towards a love of simple country pleasures in the world that was becoming increasingly urbanised, frightening and complex. The countryside which until his time was viewed as a place of toil where crops could be harvested and animals fattened at huge personal cost and endless hours of hard and often tedious work. As agricultural methods made farming more efficient, more people gradually became freer from the onerous labour and unpredictability of farming. Agriculture could then be appreciated from a distance with nostalgic affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new love of all things rural started with the most privileged and then permeated down to the middle classes. The first time this movement became a piece of architecture was with Marie Antoinette and her little hamlet, the ‘Hameau de la Reine’ built for her at Versailles. Here she would milk cows, feed chickens and tend sheep like a shepherdess from a toile de jouy illustration. At the time it must seemed an eccentric pastime for the Queen of France but this ill-fated and misunderstood monarch must have found it a welcome escape from the stifling formality and precarious nature of Louis XVI court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English caught on to this fashion during the mid 18th century and it became one of the many styles they adopted along with Chinese, Turkish and Gothic. The cottage style or cottage ornée as it was commonly known started a fashion which has continued in an almost unbroken line down to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/17.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of architecture hypnotised the Victorian era with their nostalgia for a golden age of rural bliss before the gruelling cruel realities of the industrial revolution. This led to the Arts and Crafts movement where the cottage and the vernacular approach became the favourite style of many architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens being the most famous exponent designed dozens of cottage style houses throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/18.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/19.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English love of cottages continued into the 20th century, and when the heroes came back from the First World War the simple cottage within its own garden was seen as a fitting reward for their labour. This led to the extensive interwar suburbs that surround most English towns and cities having houses that refer to cottage architecture in their detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love of the simple rural life which inspired Marie Antoinette, has come down to us through the eyes of Constable, Lutyens and their followers. Although the French queen’s invented world at Hameau with it’s porcelain milking buckets have been replaced by cheese making rock stars and fiercely protected rural landscapes, there is a love of the simple rural life which touches the souls of each and every one of us. Constable’s depiction illustrates the harmonious partnership between the body of man, the body of animals and the body of the earth, as the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva would describe it. This is mankind as part of nature and not separate to it. Now, in these environmentally conscious times this should strike a chord in everyone’s hearts, making the Haywain not only one of the most loved paintings but also one of the most relevant to grow from English soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I did a short podcast with my son Alfie. We talked about many things, but to kick off we discussed the romantic view of beauty in which artists aimed to ‘stun’ and not necessarily please. This led on to a conversation about the rock band Joy Division and we wrestled with the question that if architecture is ‘frozen music’, as Goethe suggests, what sort of music should architects play. Follow the link below to hear the whole discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
