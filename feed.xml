        <title>NPPF Paragraph 80e Explained</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many people, perhaps you, would love to build yourself a new house in the country where you could live with your family and work from home in rural tranquility. It is perhaps the English dream. The problem is getting planning permission. But don’t despair, NPPF paragraph 80e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. The clause states that the new house has to be an ‘exceptional’ work of architecture and so it is not easy to get planning permission… but not impossible. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of ‘paragraph 80e’ houses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I needed to get a puncture on my daughter’s bike repaired, I have long since given up trying to repair them myself, and so I went to the Bike Doctor in East Bergholt just down the road. He obligingly took my bike and said I’ll have this done in ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes! When I get a puncture it usually takes me about ten years to summon up the necessary enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what could I do in East Bergholt for ten minutes? I thought I would go and visit the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve lived in the area for most of my life I know East Bergholt church but not well. I have been to one or two weddings there but otherwise I have hardly ever been. Though fairly typical of the churches of the area, it is a rather amazing in its own way. It looks like the tower fell down but in fact it was never completed. Popular legend suggests that this was due to local celeb, Cardinal Wolsey’s fall from grace in 1530 ending funds to the church, but a far more likely reason was Henry VIII’s breach with Rome. With Protestant ideas gaining ground, the desire for ostentatious church buildings disappeared overnight and so work simply stopped. I have noticed in Dedham Church, when ascending the tower to wind the clock, the beginnings of elaborate fan vaulting which similarly was put on hold. It makes me wonder about the conversations between the client and master mason, who presumably had bought all the stone at a great price. How did they break the news, and did they know how final this was? I can hear the project manager saying, ‘It’s just a temporary blip, just wait until this Anne Boleyn thing has sorted itself out’, Little did they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something wonderful about seeing a building where the evidence of the makers hand stretching back hundreds of years is so evident. This is particularly easy to read because of the half-finished state of the church tower. I enjoy the wobbliness - the slight inconsistencies - caused by a medieval mason trying to get something done as best they can with the primitive tools of the time. These human touches are underpinned by the most exceptional craftsmanship, particularly the flint work. I know people who can do this type of work but it’s highly skilled, extremely expensive and time consuming. Over the years the materials have been eroded giving the walls an organic quality as if you’re looking at a cliff face or the trunk of an ancient tree. Weeds find places to grow, and moss colonises the walls in damp places under label mouldings or between dentils. Over time, the ravages of the seasons cause the walls to decay making once impenetrable stone and brick crumble and flake like a mature Cheddar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/10.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/12.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior is again very typical of parish churches up and down the land. A medieval structure with the usual layer of Victorian furniture designed to high churchify a white plain structure which the Puritans had denuded. So, we have the usual Victorian pulpit, lectern, screen, the high alter and an organ case which has something of a fairground about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorial wall tombs of all periods pepper the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always intrigued by the most recent layer of history, things just left around:- fire extinguishers, postcards raising money for the church roof and the paraphernalia of the flower rota sit cheek by jowl with ancient fonts and tombs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/17.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/17.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/18.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/st-marys-church/thumbs/18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;St Mary’s Church, East Bergholt, Suffolk&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was there, a man came in wearing a cycle helmet, he apologised for his attire. I said I didn’t mind. I think he thought I was the vicar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived back at the garage to find that the Bike Doctor had mended the puncture and also oiled the break cables which were a little rusty and loosed the gear changing mechanism which had been jammed by caked mud… all for fifteen quid, what a bargain!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no correct way to pursue a career in architecture. Often, it is perceived that high academic performance and grades are what this profession heavily relies on. In Francis’ most recent podcast, he debunks the myths and offers advice for young people interested in perusing a similar occupation. Francis is joined by his daughter, Claudia, who interviews him one on one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Secret of Popular Architecture</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2019/09/617.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I have collaborated a number of times with Create Streets, an organization which aims to promote street based and human centred architecture. I had been introduced to the founder of Create Streets, Nicholas Boys Smith, via a mutual friend from Cambridge, and I first met him in Waterstone’s cafe in Piccadilly. He arrived brandishing various pamphlets filled with hard-nosed research backing up ideas of which I agreed. Though I had an instinct that traditional urbanism with its terraced streets and town squares was a better way to build than high rise towers with indeterminate space between, I was unaware that the vast data which backed up this prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worthy as this data undoubtedly is, I felt that it probably did not make a connection with many people apart from a few academically inclined specialists in the field. So I suggested doing a counter proposal for a live site to demonstrate these important ideas and so attract a larger audience, with the aim to influence architecture for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much reflection Nicholas chose the site at Mount Pleasant Sorting Office. This was ideal because it was a large central London site which was being developed in a way which was unsympathetic to the thoughts and requirements of the local residents. They had contacted Nicholas at the time to see if Create Streets could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/news/2019/09/643.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/secret-of-popular-architecture/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas and I met the local campaigners, walked the site and then sat down with them to draw a proposal. I always enjoy sitting with people and designing a proposal in front of them, apart from being a fun experience it is also the best way to make the most of the combined wisdom of everyone in the room. Residents will always know far more about the site than an architect who only visits for a short while. Following this design day we then presented options to a broader group of local residents at a small exhibition, we followed their advice and used this to develop a more detailed design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/urbanism/01/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/drawings/mount_pleasant_1.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/drawings/thumbs/mount_pleasant_1_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Secret of Popular Architecture&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicholas and I have worked on a variety of projects in this way. Our aim is to put people, and most particularly local residents, at the heart of planning decisions. All too often other concerns like traffic, zoning and even well intentioned regulations conspire against those that are most affected by a new development. By giving people a voice, our work is much more popular than a scheme which is developed without consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing popular architecture is one of our key aims and an aspect of building which has been largely ignored in recent years. Despite the egalitarian pretence of many architects, they all too often wilfully imposed their work on an unwilling audience with disastrous results. Through extensive consultation we aim to design schemes which are genuinely loved and thereby easing the path of new development which is much needed with the current shortage in housing.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have most enjoyed while working with Create Streets is using my talents to help people in a very direct way. Though our collaborations started as counter proposals with no realistic chance of being built, as time goes by, we are increasingly asked to design schemes which do have a real chance of coming to fruition. I look forward to seeing these proposals being built and I hope that our shared ideas will be seen to have a very positive affect on the architecture of our towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Drawing - Death Survival Revival</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you give me some paper and pencils, I’m happy and it has always been this way ever since I was a child. My earliest memories were never having enough paper, I used to draw in the blank pages in books and occasionally on walls. I found the abilities to create a world intoxicating, from lines, marks and smudges on the page people come to life, cities are built, jungles explored, and it can all be rubbed out in an instant and more things can be created in the same place…what godlike power!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was and still is my passion and therefore I am saddened by the wholesale abandonment of drawing from art education in recent times. I’m not arguing against modern art, I just feel that as an accountant should be able to add and subtract, an artist should be able to draw fluently whatever style of art he or she later decides to employ. With Picasso, for example, whatever you think of him, his exceptional drawings which he did as a child give the rest of his work an authority it would not otherwise have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at school we were taught how to draw, admittedly it was not L’École des Beaux-Arts, but we did learn the basics of perspective, composition and casting shadows. The art room as full of drawings of typewriters, sculls, musical instruments and a myriad of objects carefully rendered with painstaking precision. Today this is not the case, GCSE and ‘A’ level art is more orientated around writing about art than actually doing it. This was recently illustrated by an extremely gifted young artist who made national news by failing art GCSE. I have heard that art educators do not focus on drawing because they do not want to discriminate against those who are not talented, an issue which every other subject, particularly the maths and science boards, do not remotely worry about. The result of this well-meaning yet misplaced wokery is the accidental discrimination against talented artists who have no other way to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picasso famously said that when he was a child he drew like Raphael and it had taken his whole life to learn to draw as a child. This attitude came out of the avant garde, who saw everything that tradition valued as culpable for everything that is wrong with the world. Academic drawing fell into this category and so the drawings of an uneducated child, untainted by western civilisation, were seen as preferable to the works of Raphael. It took time for these ideas to sink in, initially it was just the opinion a few eccentric artists but gradually over the years it developed slowly until now, a hundred years later, this ideology is as mainstream and bourgeois as IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously, this unfortunate situation is not true of other art forms, everyone understands the value of a classical training in piano or ballet which involves hours of often dull hard work and disciplined study over many years. We all believe Malcolm Gladwell when he states that for the ability to do anything well, you need to practice for 10,000 hours before the age of twenty. Unfortunately drawing is now not a subject where this rule is applied, ‘self-expression’ is the aim. The result is that drawing has descended from an admired pursuit of geniuses like Leonardo and Michelangelo to little more than therapy. I do not want to deny this role of drawing; putting marks on a page to depict a form is therapeutic but splashing around in the shallow end of a swimming pool is all very well, but you’re going to enjoy it more if you learn how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my life, I have drawn comics, portraits, book illustrations, my children, stage set designs and of course buildings which I draw daily. Drawing has enriched my life in so many ways I worry that future generations of potentially talented artists who have not learnt how to draw are cheated out of something incredibly life affirming, joyful and an activity they were born to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say most art schools being ‘avant garde’ in spirit do not teach drawing. Until the 1960s, art schools had regular life drawing classes and rooms full of plaster casts of the great sculptures of antiquity and the Renaissance for students to draw. This has all gone and the casts have been chucked in a skip and the life models service is no longer required. The result is that people are voting with their feet; a decreasing number of people are taking art A level and an Art School degree is not valued by future employers, particularly me, an employer of creative people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/drawing-death-survival-revival/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing - Death Survival Revival&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is not all bad, though good drawing is not valued by the art establishment, it is still valued by a vast number of ordinary people judging by the amount of ‘how to draw’ videos on the internet and the enduring popularity of Old Masters both in galleries and exhibitions. A drawing by Raphael is still worth millions and a child’s drawing, charming as it may be, only has value for the parents. As a consequence of this counterculture movement, a few art schools do teach drawing in the tradition way and if you would like to learn how to draw, I suggest you apply to one of them. Here are a few (some also teach painting and sculpture):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.florenceacademyofart.com&quot; alt=&quot;The Florence Academy of Art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Florence Academy of Art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.academyofartbarcelona.com&quot; alt=&quot;Barcelona Academy of Art&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Academy of Art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://londonfineartstudios.com/&quot; alt=&quot;London Fine Art Studios&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;London Fine Art Studios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://grandcentralatelier.org&quot; alt=&quot;The Grand Central Atelier&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Grand Central Atelier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chelseaclassicalstudio.com/schoolofart&quot; alt=&quot;Chelsea Classical Studio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chelsea Classical Studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can just teach yourself as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Haywain by John Constable</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Haywain by John Constable&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain by John Constable, is perhaps the most famous English painting. Painted exactly two hundred years ago, the scene depicts Flatford in Suffolk which I know well as it is only a few miles from where I live and I often take my little West Highland Terrier out for walks in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/social.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the left of the Haywain is a cottage know as Willy Lott’s House. This was owned by a tenant farmer of that name in Constable’s time. It has not changed much in the intervening years thanks to carefully maintenance by the National Trust. Behind Constable’s viewpoint is Flatford Mill which was owned by the painter’s father and gave him sufficient wealth to contemplate being an artist rather than working on the land. This is a charming collection of buildings despite being built with utility rather than aesthetic in mind. There is very little self-conscious architecture to be seen apart from a Gibbsian entrance door which is shoehorned into a corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/03.jpg&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/05.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/06.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/07.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Haywain has been reproduced on countless mugs, tea towels, jigsaws and postcards all over the world. This notoriety has made Willy Lott’s House, despite its small scale, the most famous house in the country, more widely recognised than Chatsworth, Castle Howard or Blenheim. In fact, it may well be the most famous house in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/09.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/10.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable depicts Willy Lott’s House as a harmonious part of the whole scene, as natural as the trees, the mill pond and the clouds. Willy Lott, according to legend had never been outside his own horizon and the materials that built his house were similar. The timber framed structure was made from trees which grew nearby; the lime for the rendered walls would have been found in local fields and the clay for the bricks and tiles for the foundations, chimneys and roof would have been dug up and fired in a makeshift kiln close to the site. This house therefore was not an outside intervention but simply made up of the materials from the landscape rearranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Constable painted this picture, it was seen as a surprising subject for such a large scale of painting. At the time, paintings of this size and ambition would depict a biblical or historical narrative designed for the elevation and improvement of the viewer. To paint a simple landscape with a cottage and a cart in a mill pond was not nearly heroic enough. Earlier artists would have replaced Willy Lott’s house with a classical temple in the manner of Poussin or Claude Lorraine and maybe the haywain with Apollo’s chariot.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constable was part of a shift towards a love of simple country pleasures in the world that was becoming increasingly urbanised, frightening and complex. The countryside which until his time was viewed as a place of toil where crops could be harvested and animals fattened at huge personal cost and endless hours of hard and often tedious work. As agricultural methods made farming more efficient, more people gradually became freer from the onerous labour and unpredictability of farming. Agriculture could then be appreciated from a distance with nostalgic affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new love of all things rural started with the most privileged and then permeated down to the middle classes. The first time this movement became a piece of architecture was with Marie Antoinette and her little hamlet, the ‘Hameau de la Reine’ built for her at Versailles. Here she would milk cows, feed chickens and tend sheep like a shepherdess from a toile de jouy illustration. At the time it must seemed an eccentric pastime for the Queen of France but this ill-fated and misunderstood monarch must have found it a welcome escape from the stifling formality and precarious nature of Louis XVI court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/14.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/15.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/15.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English caught on to this fashion during the mid 18th century and it became one of the many styles they adopted along with Chinese, Turkish and Gothic. The cottage style or cottage ornée as it was commonly known started a fashion which has continued in an almost unbroken line down to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/16.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/16.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/17.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/17.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of architecture hypnotised the Victorian era with their nostalgia for a golden age of rural bliss before the gruelling cruel realities of the industrial revolution. This led to the Arts and Crafts movement where the cottage and the vernacular approach became the favourite style of many architects. Sir Edwin Lutyens being the most famous exponent designed dozens of cottage style houses throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/18.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/18.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/19.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/the-haywain/thumbs/19.jpg&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The English love of cottages continued into the 20th century, and when the heroes came back from the First World War the simple cottage within its own garden was seen as a fitting reward for their labour. This led to the extensive interwar suburbs that surround most English towns and cities having houses that refer to cottage architecture in their detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love of the simple rural life which inspired Marie Antoinette, has come down to us through the eyes of Constable, Lutyens and their followers. Although the French queen’s invented world at Hameau with it’s porcelain milking buckets have been replaced by cheese making rock stars and fiercely protected rural landscapes, there is a love of the simple rural life which touches the souls of each and every one of us. Constable’s depiction illustrates the harmonious partnership between the body of man, the body of animals and the body of the earth, as the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva would describe it. This is mankind as part of nature and not separate to it. Now, in these environmentally conscious times this should strike a chord in everyone’s hearts, making the Haywain not only one of the most loved paintings but also one of the most relevant to grow from English soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I did a short podcast with my son Alfie. We talked about many things, but to kick off we discussed the romantic view of beauty in which artists aimed to ‘stun’ and not necessarily please. This led on to a conversation about the rock band Joy Division and we wrestled with the question that if architecture is ‘frozen music’, as Goethe suggests, what sort of music should architects play. Follow the link below to hear the whole discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;townley-1-3&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/02.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/02a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite houses is Townley Hall in in County Louth, Ireland. It is not open to the public but the institution that owns it are happy for enthusiasts to look round, which I did a many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley shares the classic rise and fall of many Irish country houses. The estate had belonged to the Townley family since Cromwellian times. Passing through various sons and nephews, it was Blayney Townley Balfour who in 1794 commissioned Francis Johnston to design the present house. The family owned it until 1957 and then it passed through various hands until eventually it was bought in the 1980s by its current owner, the School of Philosophy and Economic Science, who use it as a residential study centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley’s plan follows the classic ‘noughts and crosses’ form with a circular staircase hall in the middle. This makes for an efficient plan as all the rooms are around the edge making use of the natural light and the central space is lit from above, so all areas have light throughout the building. Also having a staircase in the centre makes for excellent circulation as all the rooms can be connected without the use of corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘noughts and crosses’ plan has a long history going back to Palladio’s Villa Rotunda and the slightly later Villa Rocca Pisana by Scamozzi. Two centuries later this basic building type became a staple of Georgian architecture, being the inspiration behind houses like Chiswick House and Mereworth Castle. It was the Georgians who came up with the next innovation of putting a staircase in the central hall, which was done by a number of architects, most famously by James Paine at New Wardour Castle in Wiltshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the Townley estate, the first thing you see is a Greek Revival gate house which sits on the roadside and sets the tone for the house beyond. After driving through the gates, you come into an area of dense woodland which gives way to a beautiful park where the house sits on the high point of the estate. This arrival sequence was not doubt carefully stage managed by a landscape designer of the Capacity Brown school. The house itself is a simple grey stone block almost modernist in its lack of ornament and architectural detailing. Large evenly spaced sash windows punctuate the facades with no surrounds, rustication or pediments. The only piece of ornament is a Greek Revival porch; I say Greek revival, but the Doric columns are far thinner than anything in Ancient Greece and the entablature is straight out of Vignola which makes it Italian Renaissance. But it is none the worse for its eclectic sources. This muted exterior gives nothing away about the excitement of the rotunda within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/09.jpg&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/11.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;

			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this staircase hall that makes Townley a masterpiece and one of the greatest examples of Neoclassical architecture to be seen. This type of stairs, known as a cantilevered stair, has a long history going back millennia. Significantly Palladio wrote about them in Book One of his Four Books of Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/13.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/thumbs/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/14.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/townley-hall/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Townley Hall - A Pantheon in Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the ‘nought and crosses’ plans, English Palladians took their master’s staircase form and reused it with aplomb as can be seen at the Queen’s House, Greenwich and the Dean’s Staircase at St Paul’s. Excellent as these examples by Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren undoubtably are, neither compare with the sheer beauty of Johnston’s staircase at Townley. The whole sequence of seeing the staircase from the entrance hall, framed by the curve of the first floor landing above which reads as an arch, then moving into the round hall and seeing the coffered dome with its massive oculus which gradually reveals itself as you move forward. The scale of the top light apart from bringing in a huge amount of light also means that you can see clouds wafting past and this effects the amount of light in the room moment by moment and so you feel as if you are almost outside. The staircase itself is the thinnest cantilevered staircase imaginable and with its gentle pitch and the smooth underside it gracefully glides up to the light filled pantheon above.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this space the walls and dome are ornamented with elegant plasterwork, which is all modelled in shallow relief, and so despite there being a lot of decoration in this space, it does not seem overpowering. The floor also has the most subtle decoration consisting of a complex pattern which is pieced together from the same coloured stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms that surround the rotunda continue the serene simplicity of the elevations and have varying lengths, but all are 24ft in width. There is some ornament on the ceilings and fireplaces, but this like elsewhere in the house is incredibly light and delicate. When I saw the house, these rooms were painted in a variety of colours, some quite bright and filled with the paraphernalia of its educational function. I would love to see what these rooms would look like painted in carefully chosen shades of off white and sparsely populated with Georgian furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Townley is the end of a long tradition of classical architecture stretching back in an unbroken line to the Renaissance. During the late 18th century this lineage was starting to fragment as gothic, chinoiserie and a myriad of other styles became fashionable. Eventually gothic dominated and Francis Johnson responded by becoming a master of this style too. It would be interesting to speculate how differently the modernist movement would have evolved if it were not for a hostile reaction to the sketchbook froofiness of the Victorians, and instead took off from where Townley landed. Perhaps the architecture of the 20th century would have more taste, charm and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Ancient Love of Quality</title>

	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality is so important. It is the different between mass produced bleached white sliced bread assembled in a factory and bread lovingly made in small batches by a baker who really cares. The ingredients are much the same, but the differences are enormous. Whether it is the pleasure of sinking your teeth into a perfect slice of bread or the sensation of turning a well-made door handle, we humans love quality in all its many forms.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I was in a discussion with some architects whose taste was the polar opposite to mine. It was only when we began discussing the amazing quality of Victorian terraces that we found some common ground. I have come to believe that quality is the only thing that unites all architects from traditionalists like me to modernists like Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. But why is quality so important? Surely if something does its job then that is enough! But we humans are not like that, we want things to be better than they need to be and we can see a beauty in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the quality of the finished buildings which is the reason I take so much pleasure in designing country houses. My clients also share this passion, and we go to great lengths to satisfy this desire. For example, we recently completed an orangery in Norfolk designed in brick which demanded immense care and attention to detail and deliver the pristine finish required. We were using a strong coloured red brick with a white mortar which would really show up any slight mistakes and poor workmanship. This was extremely hard to do but everyone felt that the effort was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/06.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/07.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/acheulian-hand-axes/07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our Ancient Love of Quality&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are curious in their love of quality and it has very ancient roots. This can be seen from the evidence left by prehistoric tools, most notably the often beautifully made Acheulian hand axes which were produced by our early ancestors from 1,760,000 to 130,000 years ago. These exquisitely crafted objects have been found in their thousands in Asia, Europe and Africa. What is surprising about them is that some were too large to use and others have no evidence of being used. It is thought that due to their symmetry and meticulous workmanship, which was far greater than required for their function, they must have been primarily objects of beauty to be marvelled at for their aesthetic qualities and virtuoso craftsmanship. I find it extraordinary to contemplate that before our ancestors had evolved into humans, they found beauty in the applied arts. Since this was over a million years before we could speak and as thought is so tied up with language, this early form of art appreciation predates our uniquely human way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, when someone made a beautiful hand axe in prehistoric times or today lays a well-crafted brick wall, though separated by hundreds of thousands of years, these objects both display evidence of the care, intelligence, and judgement of their makers which, in evolutionary terms, are desirable personal qualities and so we respond positively. When we see architecture done well, we react to this quality with an involuntary reaction that goes right back to our distant ancestral past. This is not solely a cultural response but an inherent impulse, similar to our deep, ancient and intense love of well baked bread.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Proportions in Architecture and Music</title>
        <description>&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/01.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architects for millennia have sought to find rules to determine the proportions of every aspect of a building. A window, for example, can look too narrow and thin or conversely it can look squat and fat. How can we work out the right proportions? Is there a ratio of height to width which is perfect? Many architects throughout time have felt there are mathematical formulae to achieve the right proportions. This was a particular interest of Renaissance theorists including the Florentine architect Alberti (1404-72) who saw an equivalence between musical and architectural proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am every day more and more convinced of the truth of Pythagoras’s saying, that nature is sure to act consistently and with constant analogy in all her operations: from whence I conclude, that the same numbers, by means of which the agreement of sound affects our ears with delight, are the very same which please our eyes and our minds.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;The Ten Books of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; by Alberti book IX Chapter V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic maths behind musical harmony has a clarity and simplicity which appealed to the Renaissance mind. If you take two violin strings under the same tension, with one half the length of the other, and then pluck them both, the difference in pitch is an octave which sounds beautiful. In mathematical terms what you are really enjoying is the ratio of 1:2. If the strings are in a relationship of two to three you have a ‘fifth’ and if they are in a relationship of three to four it will be a ‘fourth’, all beautiful sounds as a consequence of being specific and exact mathematical ratios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just with strings that these ratios can be observed. The same patterns can be seen in different sized bells, different lengths of metal pipe in brass bands or church organ and the different sizes of wood blocks for a xylophone.  The maths throughout these various ways of making different pitches of sound is the same and so they work with each other. If, for example, a trumpet player was to blow down a long brass tube he or she could make the notes of an arpeggio. This wind instrument’s arpeggio would fit exactly into the previously mentioned octave of the stringed instrument, if they are tuned to the same pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/02a.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/02a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Alberti states, these ideas ultimately go back to the great philosopher and mathematician Pythagorus in the 6th century BC.  He became aware of this when he walked past a blacksmith’s forge and heard the different pitches of the banging on anvils with different sized hammers. When some hammers banged at the same time, they sounded harmonious and others not. He then worked out that the hammers which achieved a pleasant sound were the ones which had a harmonic relationship between each other. For example, if one hammer was exactly twice as heavy as the other, that would produce an octave. He then went on to discover the basic maths of the musical instruments of his day. Through this he came to believe that the same simple number ratios and proportions embodied absolute truth about the harmonic structure of literally everything on earth. But Pythagoras did not stop there, he also was convinced that the same numbers and ratios were consistent throughout the whole universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If earthly objects such as strings or pieces of metal make sounds when put in motion, so too must the moon, the planets, the sun and even the highest stars. As these heavenly objects are forever in motion, orbiting the Earth, surely they must be forever producing sound.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea, known as the ‘Music of the Spheres’, is the belief that the planets and moon spin on their obits, emitting a hum, which is inaudible to us but if we could hear it, it would be some sort of celestial music expressing the perfect harmony of the universe. The planets which are further away were thought to make a lower hum than the ones closer to earth, it was as if the universe was one massive lute or harp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/03.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/04.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wonderful it would be to believe that certain proportions embody timeless irrefutable truths which are consistent throughout nature, music and architecture. It is so satisfyingly neat… but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, we still look for magical formulae to explain the complexities of the universe and this is as true for Pythagorus as it is for Einstein.  In music the octave, the fourth and the fifth still sound beautiful and are used by musicians both ancient and modern. But for architecture, does the analogy work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I do not think that musical and architectural proportions work the same way. For architectural proportions to be ‘harmonic’ they do not have to be exact. For example, if the double cube room at Wilton was not quite a double cube, is would not be any better or worse, it aims to be a cube and near enough is fine. Architectural proportion is like Goldilocks’s porridge, slightly too hot or cold is fine it is a matter of degree, the closer the better. Music is not like this, slightly wrong is the most discordant sound possible. If an octave is slightly off it sounds completely wrong, even the most tone-deaf person can hear when a violin is even slightly out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/05.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure Palladio would have enjoyed someone post rationalising one for his buildings in terms of musical ratios, but I do not think he would have been at all familiar with these ideas and he certainly did not use them in practice. I can find no written reference to this Pythagorean musical analogy in his Quattro Libri. There may be some number ratios within his designs which appear to have a reference to these ideas but as D. Howard and M. Longair state in their essay ‘Harmonic Proportions and Palladio’s Quattro Libri’ ‘…this is more likely to be down to the practical advantages of using simple easily divisible numbers’. Which makes perfect sense particularly at a time when buildings were set out by lengths of rope and crudely pegged out on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/07a.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/07a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/08.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly chimes with my understanding of Palladio’s architectural details. With his orders in the Quattro Libri, there is no attempt to use simple numbers let alone clean musical ratios. For example, the height of his Corinthian order is nine and a half times the length of the bottom diameter (rather that an even ten) and the entablature height is one diameter plus nine tenths (rather than an even two). The smaller scale details of the Corinthian order are just the same, virtually every dimension has a fraction attached and this is true for all his orders. Palladio’s drive was to represent a particular form or shape based on his knowledge of the ruins from Ancient Rome and his instinct for proportion. He therefore used whatever numbers and fractions worked to give him the exact dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/09.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one set of proportions which I believe are inherently beautiful, these are the classical orders from Ancient Rome. Quite why these proportions are so beautiful is hard to fathom but what is clear is they have nothing to do with musical ratios. In John Summerson’s excellent essay ‘Antitheses of the Quattrocento’ he sums it up in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you are unwilling to accept the five orders as a gift of a myth, delightful and glorious fundamentally because they derive from an old, forgotten world, then you must argue yourself into believing that, somehow or other, they embody absolute values of proportion and ornament; and that argument is difficult in the extreme.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If proportion cannot be attached to some absolute values all we are left with is personal judgement. There is a story about Michelangelo being criticised for making the cornice on Palazzo Farnese too large according to classical rules. To which he replied, ‘My eye is my measure’. Michelangelo, perhaps justifiable felt that his innate sense of proportion was enough with no recourse to anything else. He was effectively saying ‘I know what I like’, which does not sound like a valid architectural theory but perhaps that is all there is, and we should be honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
		&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/10.jpg&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/images/essays/proportions-in-architecture-and-music/thumbs/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Proportions in Architecture and Music&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the office we spend hours analysing our designs and trying different proportions of windows and doors in slightly different places to ensure that we have designed the best possible building within the given constraints. It is worth taking time to get these things right because a well-proportioned building costs the same as a badly proportioned one yet is worth so much more. We do this primarily by intuition. This process is not academic or theoretical, but if some latter-day Alberti comes along and finds musical ratios in my work which ties into some greater cosmic order, I certainly will not complain but it does not make it true.&lt;/p&gt;
