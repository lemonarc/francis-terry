The Erechtheum is on the north side of the Acropolis, build between 421 and 406BC. In this video, filmed during the Seventh Catalysis Conference in 2017, Francis discusses what makes it so unusual for a classical building, touching on its different roles.

After discussing its architectural features and patterns, he goes on to talk about its influence on English architecture in the 18th century, when Greek architecture was seen to be a much gentler design than Roman. Perhaps this is why when Willian Wilkins built his new Acropolis at Downing College he chose this style â€“ that by following in the manner of the home of the ancient philosophers, a new Plato or Aristotle would emerge.
