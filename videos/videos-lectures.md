		<h2>An Introduction to the Architecture of the Italian Renaissance</h2>
		<h4>May 2018</h4>
		<p>
			This is a video of my ‘in house’ office lecture about the Italian Renaissance. This lecture covers one of the greatest outbursts of creativity in the history of western art and architecture.

		<h2>An Introduction to Baroque Architecture</h2>
		<h4>February 2019</h4>
		<p>
			This is a lecture I gave to the office about the baroque movement in architecture. It follows on from a lecture I gave about the renaissance and is the precursor to a future lecture on neoclassicism.

		<h2>An Introduction to 18th Century Architecture: From Rococo to Neo Classicism</h2>
		<h4>December 2019</h4>
		<p>
			The 18th century is where I go routinely for inspiration. There is something magical about Georgian architecture which everyone seems to enjoy no matter who they are. Historically I see the 18th century as the transition from traditional society to the modern world. As catholicism gradually lost its power, the Baroque style also began to lose its grip and evolved into the Rococo. Like the last moments of a dying star which produces the many and varied elements of the universe, the Rococo was Baroque in an explosive, dynamic and beautiful decline.

		<h2>An Introduction to British Architecture from Queen Victoria to George VI</h2>
		<h4>March 2020</h4>
		<p>
			The Victorian age inherited the battle of styles which defined the end of the Georgian era, a battle which was not convincingly won by either side. Gothic, Classical and even Mughal style architecture were all available to patrons and architects.

		<h2>English Architecture Between the Wars</h2>
		<h4>March 2020</h4>
		<p>
			It is hard to imagine the decimation caused by the First World War. Understandably, a growing number of people started to feel that there was something terribly wrong with a civilisation which caused young boys from neighbouring countries to commit murder for a purpose that no one really knew or understood.
