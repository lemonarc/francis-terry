On the 1st of April 2011 Francis entered the unfamiliar territory of ‘Banksy’s Tunnel’ in London’s Leake Street to spend the whole day treating the graffitied walls as a classical facade.

Using his knowledge of Renaissance ornament and proportion he attempted to bring harmony and order to the chaos and confusion of the Leake Street tunnel.

Ben Moore founder of Art Below comments ‘The scene is wonderfully ironic - Classicists are usually seen as being quaint and conservative, and the grafiti world is the polar opposite but somehow by Francis Terry doing a piece in the tunnel ends up being the most revolutionary act of all.'
