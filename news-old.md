			Being a visiting critic for student schemes is not something I routinely do. The previous time I did it may well have been in the last century. So it was something of a novelty and to my slight surprise, I really enjoyed it.

			Francis has recently attended the American Institute of Classical Architecture's (ICAA) board retreat in Dallas, Texas. This was a great opportunity to meet and exchange ideas with the most eminent classical architects of America. As part of the event Francis carried out a large architectural drawing, over the course of a day, with fellow architects, Larry Boerder and Daniel Heath.

		<p>Jonathan Prynn reports in the Evening Standard 1st December 2016</p>
		<p>
			<em>Campaigners including Downton Abbey star Jim Carter who are opposed to "flawed" plans for "vast housing blocks" on council-owned land in north London have drawn up a "more sensitive" alternative proposal. They have commissioned classical architect Francis Terry to create designs for the redevelopment of the site in West Hampstead based on "traditional red-brick mansion style buildings in keeping with the local area".</em>

			Our proposal for Mount Pleasant, London has been submitted for what, if successful will be Britain's largest Community Right to Build Order. The community has been working on the proposal for the sorting office since 2014 as an alternative to what they viewed as an unsympathetic scheme for the city.
