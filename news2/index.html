		<p>Francis gave a zoom talk on his sketching through the decades to the Traditional Architects Group recently. Sketchbooks have always been a critical part of an architect’s work. Francis Terry has a collection of sketchbooks going back forty years to his childhood holidays in Italy sketching architecture with his father, Quinlan Terry. Over the decades he has used sketchbooks as a source of inspiration for his architecture and other artistic ventures ranging from paintings to book illustrations and stage set designs. In this talk, Francis discusses his work from his various sketchbooks and focus on how these drawings inspired his work.</p>

		<p>What makes good architecture? The Roman architect Vitruvius states that it is the combination of firmitas (firmness or structural strength), utilitas, (usefulness or function) and venustas (beauty). In this video I attempt to understand what Vitruvius actually meant by analysing the original text with the help of my son Alfred who is a classics student at the University of Manchester.</p>

		<p>Over the past few years I have collaborated a number of times with Create Streets, an organization which aims to promote street based and human centred architecture. I had been introduced to the founder of Create Streets, Nicholas Boys Smith, via a mutual friend from Cambridge, and I first met him in Waterstone’s cafe in Piccadilly. He arrived brandishing various pamphlets filled with hard-nosed research backing up ideas of which I agreed. Though I had an instinct that traditional urbanism with its terraced streets and town squares was a better way to build than high rise towers with indeterminate space between, I was unaware that the vast data which backed up this prejudice.</p>

		<p>Drawing was, and still is, my passion and therefore I am saddened by the wholesale abandonment of drawing from art education in recent times. I’m not arguing against modern art, I just feel that as an accountant should be able to add and subtract, an artist should be able to draw fluently whatever style of art he or she later decides to employ. With Picasso, for example, whatever you think of him, his exceptional drawings which he did as a child give the rest of his work an authority it would not otherwise have.</p>

		<p>Until recently my knowledge of Manchester architecture was limited to the inside gatefold of ‘The Queen is Dead’ LP. This shows the Smith’s standing outside the Salford Lads Club, where a terracotta Scamozzi Ionic capital can be seen cheekily peaking our over Morissey’s shoulder. I imagined the rest of the city continued in this vein, which indeed it does but with a scale, grandeur and flamboyance I could have only dreamed of.</p>

		<p>Many people, would love to build a new house in the country. The problem is getting planning permission. But don't despair, NPPF paragraph 79e is the planning legislation which is specifically written to allow this to happen. In this video architect Francis Terry and planning specialist Martin Leay discuss how this can be done in practical terms using examples of their many past successes of 'paragraph 79e' houses.</p>

		<p>In these days, when travel restrictions are foisted upon us, I have found myself reminiscing about adventures of days gone by.  Years ago, in my student days, I measured the Raimondi chapel, which is a side chapel dedicated to St Francis in San Pietro in Montori on the Janiculum hill in Rome. The chapel was designed by Bernini and filled with sculpture from his studio.</p>
