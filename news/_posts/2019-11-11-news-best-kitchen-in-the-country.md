Dedham House has been short listed to the final three in Historic Houses’ new Kitchen Award, in association with Country Life.

The new award for 2019 "recognises the way our member houses evolve over the centuries to continue as family homes".

Speaking of his place in the competition, Francis said: <em>"It was a bit of a surprise really, but any praise and recognition is great, so we are thrilled."</em>

To find out more about the kitchen, <a href="/thoughts/designing-a-new-kitchen-in-our-regency-house/" alt="Read the November blog">please read the November blog</a>.

The submissions for the award were pored over by a panel of expert judges; including Sarah Beeny, property guru and television presenter, Kate Earle, one half of design studio Todhunter Earle Interiors, Giles Kime, interiors editor of Country Life, and John Sims Hilditch, founder and CEO of furniture and kitchen makers Neptune.

The overall winner will be announced on Tuesday, November 12 on stage at the Historic Houses’ national AGM.
