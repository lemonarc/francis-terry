Back in February we reported how Francis Terry had been working with Create Streets and Save the Sutton Estate on their campaign to stop the demolition of the estate in Chelsea.

This campaign was created in response to a planning application submitted by Affinity Sutton (now Clarion) in 2015 which looked to reduce both the number of social housing homes and the overall number of homes on the estate.

We are delighted to share the news that Clarion Housing have now decided to refurbish, rather than demolish, many of the flats and bring them back to life.

They made the following announcement:

<em>"Clarion Housing Group, the UK’s largest affordable housing provider, has today committed to a £37 million investment package to improve the entire Sutton Estate and deliver at least 80 new social rented homes to Kensington and Chelsea.  The plans, which will be developed with residents, will see the 106 year-old homes in blocks A-D (currently empty as they do not meet decency standards for accommodation) undergo a full refurbishment. All of the new homes will be for social rent and priority will be given to residents currently living on the estate.  Residents in the remaining 303 flats on the estate, blocks E-K & N-O, will benefit from new kitchens and bathrooms and other upgrades. Clarion has also committed to improving the outdoor spaces. The new scheme has no homes for private sale."</em>

		</a>
	</li>
</ul>

This is a fantastic result for all who campaigned against the original plans, which included 
demolishing 13 of the Sutton Estate’s 15 mansion blocks, reducing the amount of flats and selling over 100 to private buyers.  Local residents and supporters across London criticised the plan which would have seen the needless destruction of Edwardian buildings and a loss of 
affordable housing.

Our congratulations go to SOS (Save Our Sutton), with whom we worked on feasibility studies for alternative approaches during and after co-design workshops.  We hope the strong sense of community they have already shown continues to thrive, and wish them all the best in the improvements to their homes and living spaces.
