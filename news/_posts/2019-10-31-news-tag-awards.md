The Traditional Architects Group (of which Francis is the Chairman) awards were held at the Art Workers’ Guild on Tuesday 22nd October, with prizes and certificates handed out by Lord Snowdon.

The prize for best classical or traditional scheme designed by a student studying architecture at a university in the UK went to Aleksandra Zenfa, for her Greek revival hotel in Inverness, Scotland.

Runner up was Michail Sarafidis, who transformed an abandoned house in Siracuse, Sicily, into a classical style restaurant and bar.
Greg Oleniacz, Anthony Fitheoglou and Aurelio Miranda were all short listed.  The five finalists were all students of a course run by Timothy Smith and Jonathan Taylor at Kingston University.  This is the only course in the country which specialises in classical architecture.  It has been running for nearly a decade, and the quality of their students’ work is a testament to their excellent teaching.

The prize for best measured drawing of a historic building went to Jakub Ryng for his drawing of a façade by Boehmer & Gibbs at 65 Harley Street built in 1910.
Runner up was Timothy Lewis, for his drawing of the Newcastle Pew, St George’s Church, Esher designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1725.

Overall the standard of entries was exceptionally high, and the Traditional Architects Group thanked everyone who entered either competition.

The Lifetime Achievement award was presented to HRH The Prince of Wales for his ongoing support of traditional architecture and his approach to learning from the past in order to inform how we shape the future.  Unfortunately, he was unable to attend in person, although he did send a statement of thanks which was read by Simon Hurst, TAG’s communication secretary.

As well as presenting the awards, Lord Snowdon gave a brief address about his experiences as a furniture designer and his huge dept to the classical style, which was very well received.
