<p>Our proposal for Mount Pleasant, London has been submitted for what, if successful will be Britain's largest Community Right to Build Order. The community has been working on the proposal for the sorting office since 2014 as an alternative to what they viewed as an unsympathetic scheme for the city. Community led from the start and with a vast amount of consultation and co-design, this has resulted in an urban design of characterful mansion blocks with a strong sense of place, mixed use and human scale although higher density and higher value than the RMG's preferred scheme. In all local polls and workshops it has received between 95 and 99% local support. The professional team is made up of The Mount Pleasant Neighbourhood Forum - Client, Create Streets - Project manager, Maddox Associates - Planning Consultants, Francis Terry and Associates with Calfordseaden - Architects, Urban Engineering Studios - Engineers, Alexandra Steed Urban - Landscape Design.</p>
