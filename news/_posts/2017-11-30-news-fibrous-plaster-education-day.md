	As part of our continual professional development, we spent a day with the fibrous plaster firm Locker and Riley. We were given an introduction to every part of making fibrous plaster, from modelling a detail in clay, to casting the finished product. We all enjoyed the hands-on experience of working with the different materials. As well as the practical side, we had some informative lectures on the history of plasterwork as well as its modern application. We also learned about the work Locker and Riley are doing in London's West End to ensure the safety of many of the elaborate theatre ceilings.
