	Francis Terry and Associates have been granted planning permission to build a new country house in Hampshire. The permission was passed by making use of the NPPF exception, which allows new truly outstanding houses to be built in open countryside if they are deemed to be 'exceptional' works of architecture. It is a high bar for any architect to achieve and would not have happened without an excellent planning team headed up by Rural Solutions with Colson Stone for garden design.
