	This year, the Traditional Architecture Group (TAG) held its first awards party on 31st October at the Art Workers’ Guild. TAG was honoured to have David Linley to hand out the awards, and there was also a speech by the chairman, Francis Terry. The evening was well attended by TAG members and their friends, including the winners, and runners up of the Student Design and Measured Drawing Competition. In addition TAG handed out a posthumous award for a Lifetime’s Achievement which went to Professor David Watkin who sadly died earlier this year. Professor Watkin was considered as a worthy recipient because he has done, perhaps more than any other academic, to champion the cause of traditional and classical architecture.
