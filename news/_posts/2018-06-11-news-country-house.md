	Francis Terry and Associates have been granted planning permission to build a new country house in Wiltshire. The permission was passed making use of the NPPF exception, which allows new truly outstanding houses to be built in open countryside if they are deemed ‘exceptional’ works of architecture. It is a high bar for any architect to achieve and would not have happened without an excellent planning team managed by RBA Project Solutions Ltd and headed up by Rural Solutions with Randle Siddeley for garden design.
