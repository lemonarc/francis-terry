			Poundbury in Dorset is a new town designed by a variety of architects under a master plan by Leon Krier. Earlier this month I was invited there, to guide a tour from the ICAA.

			“Why did the chicken cross the road?” is not a great joke. What interests me more is where the chicken crosses the road in people’s minds. When asked the question, what do you imagine?

			Dalibor Vesely (1934-2015) is the subject of legend at Cambridge University.  He was my diploma tutor at the Faculty of Architecture, where he taught during the 80s and 90s.

		<h4>April 2017</h4>

		<h4>March 2017</h4>

			One of the most universally adored details of all classical architecture is the Ionic capital at the Erechtheion on the north side of the Acropolis, built between 421 and 406 BC. Phidias was both sculptor and mason of the structure and was employed by Pericles...

		<h4>February 2017</h4>
		<p>
			The definition of Pastiche is 'an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work, artist, or period.' I imitate historic buildings, rather than inventing new styles, and with this in mind, it may seem fair game to direct the word at my work...

		<h4>January 2017</h4>
		<p>
			Architects are always presumed to be good at maths and physics. This suggests that people feel the primary role of an architect is to make a building stand up, which is curious because architect in the UK are not licenced to carry out this task. Perhaps architects are to blame...

		<h4>December 2016</h4>

			As a practicing classical architect, I have had a number of clients who have wanted their houses to look like the work of the English Palladians of the Georgian era rather than Palladio himself. From this I started to notice that the work of the English Palladians...

			In the early 1990s, Washington DC was not just the capital, but also the murder capital, of the United States. Despite this, I found it a surprisingly enjoyable place to live, when I spent the year out before my diploma there, working for the eminent classical architect Allan Greenberg...

			On occasions I meet architects who think that they are, or more often should be, 'in charge' of every aspect of their buildings.  These people are either very naive or deluded.  They harp back to a golden age when architects were taken seriously like doctors or lawyers...
