<h2>Watch your project come to life in front of you</h2>

<h4><strong>Struggling to find an architect?</strong></h4>
<p>
	Choosing the right architectural practice for your project can feel like an enormous decision. Meetings and telephone discussions can only tell you so much. We prefer to show you, during what we call a Taster Day.
</p><p>
	Your time is precious - and no doubt short. This is why the agenda for our Taster Day is modelled around the output you would  like from the day. You’ll have the opportunity to work with Francis Terry who will draw out your project in front of you - demonstrating his ability to develop a proposal that meets your wishes and needs.
</p><p class="spacer">
	As well as furthering your design, you will get an insight into our working method and the opportunity to meet the team and see if we are the right firm for you. Team communication and rapport with your architect is critical to the success of any project. The Taster Day will give you a glimpse into how your project would run - should you choose Francis Terry & Associates.
