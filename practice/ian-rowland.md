Ian started working as an architectural assistant at 18 whilst studying part-time at university to gain a BSc degree in Architectural Design Technology with Honours in 2005. Ian has a great deal of experience in many sectors including residential development, one off houses, swimming pools, leisure complexes, commercial offices, and healthcare facilities. As a result, Ian has knowledge of many types of construction from traditional masonry and steel framed buildings, to off-site construction methods using glulam structural timbers and fully finished wall and roof panels for delivery to site. Ian has been working for Francis since 2012 on various projects and enjoys the complexities of piecing a building together and is fascinated by the forms and proportions within classical architecture.
