	Leah joined the practice in September 2019 to cover Jo’s maternity leave. 
</p><p>
	It is a job with a great deal of variety, from creating invoices and working with the accountants to proof reading Francis’s books, illustrating blogs and arranging exhibitions.
</p><p>
	Leah knew prior to starting that it would be a diverse position, although 2020 created some obstacles and issues that no one could have foresaw!  Her positivity and ‘can do’ attitude help her turn large scale projects in to manageable steps.</p>
