<h3>MA (Cantab), Architect, Chairman of RIBA’s Traditional Architecture Group (TAG)</h3>

		Those who turn to Francis Terry to design their classical buildings are not simply looking for an architect, but an artist. They want beautiful spaces, plans that really work, and rooms that are liveable – but also something more. Something exquisite.
	</p><p>
		A classical building designed by Francis Terry becomes a treasure for generations to come, at once respecting the elements of classical design and reflecting contemporary life.
	</p><p>
		Like all great artistry, it begins with nothing more than a pencil.
	</p><p>
		Francis draws as he speaks. His words reveal a contagious love of classical architecture – its harmony, simplicity, and the way the finest examples feel inevitable as they meld effortlessly into their surroundings. For Francis, Classicism is about pure and simple beauty. Nothing more, nothing less.
	</p><p>
		His pencil transforms a blank sheet of tracing paper into a building, a home, a landmark addition to a landscape. Listening attentively to the needs and preferences of his clients, Francis’ ability to capture and refine a vision is quite simply unparalleled.

		"You can’t begin to design a building until you understand and know your client. If someone doesn’t want any input and they just want me to do a house, I can happily do that. But, at the end of the day, that will just be the house I wanted to do. What I find interesting in architecture is uncovering those very specific requirements – the way somebody cooks, the people they invite to supper, all the particulars of a life."
	</p>
</div>

<div class="wrapper-no-clear">
	<p>
		Beginning with an open, collaborative relationship, Francis’ buildings address the needs of the people that live within them, while seamlessly balancing the classical tradition with more contemporary design.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="wrapper-no-clear">
	<p class="quotation">
		"Classic buildings were designed for a very different time. It’s about what can still work in a classical template, in the same way that Palladio in the 1500s was doing buildings that he felt were Roman houses. They weren’t Roman houses at all – they were Renaissance houses, which were completely different, but classical nonetheless. I use the language of Classicism, but the buildings I articulate with that language are very much usable in the present."

		By considering the modern alongside classical architecture, Francis’ buildings become rich, varied experiences.

<div class="wrapper-no-clear">
	<p class="quotation">
		"Some things suit a modern look much better, in the same way some things suit a traditional look much better. It’s all personal taste and I just try to understand, capture, and reflect that in my work."

		Francis Terry forges out to build something of his own
	</p><p>
		Sitting in the boardroom in the new FTA offices, Francis talks about his reasons for setting out on his own and leaving his father Quinlan Terry’s practice. Throughout, he’s apprehensively exhilarated  to discover what he can do in his own right.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="wrapper">
	<p class="quotation">
		"My father had his own way of doing things and I’m wanting to find my way of doing things. I want to see what my buildings look like – not to impose my voice, which would very much be the opposite of what classical architecture should be, but, now that I know how you do architecture, to do it freely."

		<h3>About Francis Terry<br />
		<small>Director, Francis Terry & Associates</small></h3>
		<lineout></lineout>
		<p>
			Francis’ pursuit of architecture grew out of his passion for drawing and his love of historic buildings. He studied architecture at Cambridge University, using his talents to design numerous stage sets for societies including The Footlights, The Cambridge Opera Society and The European Theatre Group.
		</p><p>
			After qualifying in 1994 , Francis briefly worked for Allan Greenburg Architects in Washington DC, before spending over 20 years working with his father – classical architect Quinlan Terry. In 2004, Francis became a partner and began to develop his own reputation as an independent architect winning competitions and working on his own commissions.
		</p><p>
			Alongside architecture, Francis is a keen artist – he draws schemes and paints watercolours of his proposals. He also regularly exhibits drawings in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.
