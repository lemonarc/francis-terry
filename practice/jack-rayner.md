	Whilst completing his BSc in Architectural Technology, Jack has made his mark in the team by mastering 3D modelling. His skill in turning 2D images into actual models has helped not only with design solutions within the studio, but in helping clients to really see their dreams come to life in conjunction with Francis’s water colours.
